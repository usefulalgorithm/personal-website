## betcover!! - 卵

  This is probably my favorite album of theirs. It's got just the right amount of flair without making the whole thing sounding like a jumble of underdeveloped ideas.

  Release date: 2022-12-21

  [8.3/10]

## Maya Shenfeld - Under the Sun

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0057454816_16.jpg)

  [8.1/10]

## Porcelain - Porcelain

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2743558552_16.jpg)

  I would tell my kids that they are Unwound. Well a little less experimental and more hardcore-y, but the similarity is definitely there. Looking forward to what they are up to next.

  Release date: 2007-06-04

  [7.8/10]

## Stik Figa, The Expert - Ritual

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0316368825_16.jpg)

  [7.6/10]

## William Doyle - Springs Eternal

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/914713/large/0ce9437c-1be0-c523-018a-3bfb152cef30.jpg)

  This one has that Elvis Costello kind of vibe to it. Not bad but also not a huge fan of it.

  Release date: 2024-02-16

  [6.9/10]

## Goyard Ibn Said - Goyard Comin': Exordium

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4223491488_16.jpg)

  Ghais Guevara’s alter ego. Compared to the main persona this one’s more clout driven, but still has its serious moments.

  Release date: 2023-07-09

  [6.6/10]

## The Callous Daoboys - Celebrity Therapist

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0509988875_16.jpg)

  The Dillinger Escape Plan with a bunch more samples and melodic passages. Not gonna lie but this is kind of annoying...

  Release date: 2022-09-02

  [6.0/10]
