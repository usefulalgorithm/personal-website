## Moin - Paste

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0190779692_16.jpg)

  Math-rock / post-hardcore. Really glad there are still people making this kind of music.

  Release date: 2022-10-28

  [8.7/10]

## Emeralds - Solar Bridge

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1984358756_16.jpg)

  Sparwling electronic drone.

  Release date: 2022-09-30

  [8.4/10]

## Duval Timothy - Meeting with a Judas Tree

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0471216186_16.jpg)

  Wonky, warbly R&B solo piano. I dig this.

  Release date: 2022-11-11

  [8.4/10]

## Oren Ambarchi - Shebang

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0393255258_16.jpg)

  Droning jazz. Like Bill Frisell but less friendly... I dig this a lot.

  Release date: 2022-09-30

  [8.3/10]

## Lynyn - Lexicon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0055427972_16.jpg)

  Kinetic IDM. Normally I'd find this kind of stuff a little hard to sit thru, but not this one.

  Release date: 2022-07-15

  [8.2/10]

## Clark - 05-10

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0594522118_16.jpg)

  Haven't really listened to any of his stuff other than the marvellous `Body Riddle`, but this is quite pleasant to listen to. The first several tracks are super fire, whereas the latter tracks are more atmospheric ambient tracks.

  Release date: 2022-09-30

  [8.2/10]

## Nas - King's Disease III

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27304072ea3871d4fea30e1f2c8)

  I didn't expect this one to be this good... the beats are dope and the flows are nice, don't see what's not to like on this one.

  Release date: 2022-11-11

  [8.1/10]

## Ulla - Limitless Frame

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1660591416_16.jpg)

  Although I still think `Tumbling Towards a Wall` is her best work to date, this is nevertheless pretty solid ambient music. While the former focused more on the lo-fi, heavily degraded instrumental loops and glitches, this one wants to create an atmosphere that is at once warm and immersive. Or I guess I'm just trying to say this is more like traditional ambient music (which I enjoy) than TTaW...

  Release date: 2022-08-10

  [8.1/10]

## Girl In Synthesis - The Rest is Distraction

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1786802869_16.jpg)

  Noisy post-punk. I dig the riffs and vibe on this one.

  Release date: 2022-10-14

  [7.9/10]

## Horse Lords - Comradely Objects

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0155432732_16.jpg)

  This one feels a lot more conventional than their earlier stuff. Or maybe conventional is not the correct way to describe this, but that this is an album where you can find many similarity with a lot of other bands like Black Midi, The Comet is Coming and so on.

  Release date: 2022-11-04

  [7.7/10]

## Ulla - foam

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2199026417_16.jpg)

  This feels more lighthearted than her other stuff. Or just a bunch of pretty good samples stacked together...

  Release date: 2019-06-21

  [7.7/10]

## Sarah Davachi - Two Sisters

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3815953652_16.jpg)

  Mood today: extreme gloom ambient pipe organ music...

  Release date: 2022-09-09

  [7.5/10]

## Daniel Avery - Ultra Truth

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2631565452_16.jpg)

  Club-friendly ambient techno. I can imagine me banging my head to it if I go to a club (I don't) and the DJ is playing this, but when I'm listening alone I'd stick with `Song for Alpha` instead of this.

  Release date: 2022-11-04

  [7.4/10]

## Rival Consoles - Now Is

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1538288243_16.jpg)

  This is more fun than their album from last year.

  Release date: 2022-10-14

  [7.3/10]

## Dry Cleaning - Stumpwork

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2082562256_16.jpg)

  Post-punk-y Stereolab? Or at least it gives me that kind of vibe. But then I guess I would stick to just, I don't know, Stereolab themselves?

  Release date: 2022-10-21

  [7.1/10]

## Gloria de Olivia, Dean Hurley - Oceans of Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2742479750_10.jpg)

  Dean Hurley has always (or at least as far as I know of) been doing somewhat spooky electro-ambient, so this is definitely very different from that... Really really dreamy dream-pop. Sounds pretty good but doesn't have those kind of songs that make bands like Beach House great.

  Release date: 2022-09-16

  [7.0/10]

## Sudan Archives - Natural Brown Prom Queen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1589291795_16.jpg)

  R&B / pop. This one is extremely well received but honestly I really don't get the hype...

  Release date: 2022-09-09

  [6.6/10]

## Angry Son - Pranks for the Memory

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2542860774_16.jpg)

  Screamo. I like the angrier songs on this EP, but even so they're not really that good.

  Release date: 2020-05-11

  [6.2/10]

## Ripatti Deluxe - Speed Demon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0900556404_16.jpg)

  Gets repetitive after a while. Still dig the Vladislav Delay project than the other projects he's done.

  Release date: 2022-10-28

  [6.0/10]
