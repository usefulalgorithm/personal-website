## Yo La Tengo - This Stupid World

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0932855106_16.jpg)

  Strong AOTY candidate. So good.

  Release date: 2023-02-10

  [9.0/10]

## Not Waving - The Place I've Been Missing

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3539783518_16.jpg)

  Electronic / ambient pop / trip-hop. Cohesive and beautiful.

  Release date: 2023-06-23

  [8.4/10]

## Squid - O Monolith

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1582129034_16.jpg)

  I imagine this is what Frank Zappa would do if he's a millenial? Discordant / weirdly harmonious prog post-punk music.

  Release date: 2023-06-09

  [8.4/10]

## Chained to the Bottom of the Ocean - Obsession Destruction

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3126224053_16.jpg)

  FFO Thou. This thing totally rips, I dig it.

  Release date: 2023-05-12

  [8.3/10]

## Regis - Gymnastics

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/434226/large/8718723090438.jpg)

  Pounding industrial techno.

  Release date: 2016-09-09

  [8.3/10]

## Thantifaxath - Hive Mind Narcosis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3502633251_16.jpg)

  Chaotic avant-garde black metal band is back, and is just as gnarly as before. Menacing stuff.

  Release date: 2023-06-02

  [8.2/10]

## Sightless Pit - Lockstep Bloodwar

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0479069723_16.jpg)

  This is like if Justin Broadrick was a millenial.

  Release date: 2023-01-27

  [8.2/10]

## upsammy - Germ in a Population of Buildings

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0851262655_16.jpg)

  Nimble IDM. Sounds very nice.

  Release date: 2023-05-05

  [8.1/10]

## ANOHNI and the Johnsons - My Back Was a Bridge for You to Cross

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0577757592_10.jpg)

  I've never heard of Antony and the Johnsons so I came into this one thinking maybe it's like the last ANOHNI album, which is an outstanding experimental synth-pop album. And stylistically it's nothing alike - this is straight up soul music. But it is also very good.

  Release date: 2023-07-06

  [8.1/10]

## Agriculture - Agriculture

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0553098895_16.jpg)

  Romantic post-black metal. Lots of post BM bands out there but you rarely get a good one. This band is one of those good ones.

  Release date: 2023-07-21

  [8.0/10]

## Knoll - Metempiric

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0603776806_16.jpg)

  Deathgrind. Has its moments.

  Release date: 2022-06-24

  [7.5/10]

## Bendik Giske - Bendik Giske

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2192246533_16.jpg)

  Abrasive, stripped down solo saxophone album. Compared to previous albums this is much less flashy and more introspective. I kind of dig the previous ones more though...

  Release date: 2023-06-09

  [7.3/10]

## Temps - PARTY GATOR PURGATORY

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2571170960_16.jpg)

  Experimental abstract hip-hop. A very strange sounding album...

  Release date: 2023-05-19

  [7.0/10]

## Anthony Naples - Orbs

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1371724958_16.jpg)

  Chilled-out dub house. Sounds pretty good but feels just OK.

  Release date: 2023-06-02

  [6.6/10]

## Blindfolded and Led to the Woods - Rejecting Obliteration

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2323393399_16.jpg)

  Technical death metal. Some parts are pretty good, some parts are kind of generic death metal, some parts are borderline deathcore chugs.

  Release date: 2023-05-19

  [6.3/10]

## Sunrot - The Unfailing Rope

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0542573275_16.jpg)

  Metallic hardcore. Kinda meh... the spoken word parts don't really mesh all that well into the music. But it's got a Thou feature track.

  Release date: 2023-04-07

  [6.2/10]

## The Ocean - Holocene

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1499690362_16.jpg)

  Pretty lackluster. The metal tracks don't really feel all that enticing, and the ballads are no better. A far cry from `Anthropocentric`.

  Release date: 2023-05-19

  [5.5/10]
