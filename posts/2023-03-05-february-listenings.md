## Young Fathers - Heavy Heavy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0737973087_16.jpg)

  I've been following them since their first EP a while back, but I still haven't figured out what kind of music they make... Hip-hop / R&B / neo-psychedelic / gospel maybe? Someone on RYM said it's like This Heat does Animal Collective, which is actually quite on point.

  Release date: 2023-02-03

  [8.2/10]

## Rian Treanor & Ocen James - Saccades

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0755454409_10.jpg)

## Big Thief - Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0882840373_16.jpg)

  Alternative country music. I love Adrianne Lenker but somehow Big Thief has always evaded me, or maybe it is the other way around.
