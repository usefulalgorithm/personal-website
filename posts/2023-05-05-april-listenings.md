## Lucinda Chua - Yian

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3480717492_16.jpg)

  Wonderful minimalistic modern classical pop. This is so good...

  Release date: 2023-03-24

  [8.5/10]

## Carla del Forno - Come Around

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2354721515_16.jpg)

  Dub-y bedroom pop / minimal wave. I quite enjoy her previous albums but this one is my favorite yet. Super lo-fi, huge post-punk vibes.

  Release date: 2010-10-19

  [8.3/10]

## Grant Chapman - Indentations

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1343230186_16.jpg)

  Ambient. It's like Meitei + Julianna Barwick. It is very good.

  Release date: 2023-01-31

  [8.2/10]

## Stephan Mathieu, David Sylvian - Wanderm√ºde

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273ddb9b207c23042edee1bef0f)

  Wonderful ambient tracks.

  Release date: 2012-12-10

  [8.2/10]

## Tim Hecker - No Highs

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2157297652_16.jpg)

  I like the sound on this album. Very subdued.

  Release date: 2023-04-07

  [8.1/10]

## MJ Guider - Temporary Requiem

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1984562409_16.jpg)

  Doomy shoegaze.

  Release date: 2021-06-18

  [8.1/10]

## Piotr Kurek - Edena

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3368907623_16.jpg)

  Synth electronic loop music.

  Release date: 2022-10-28

  [8.1/10]

## Joanne Robertson - Blue Car

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2328132314_16.jpg)

  Dreamy indie folk. FFO Cat Power and Grouper.

  Release date: 2023-03-10

  [8.1/10]

## Binker & Moses - Feeding the Machine

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1792117924_16.jpg)

  Modern jazz. Instruments wise this is very stripped down, but it's overflowing with musical ideas. I enjoy the parts where they're just shredding or getting moody, the parts between those I feel is a bit less appealing and borderline forgettable.

  Release date: 2022-02-25

  [7.7/10]

## Yves Tumor - Praise A Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2855443234_16.jpg)

  R&B / art-rock. With each album release their music gets more grandiose and stadium rock oriented. I don't dislike it but I'd say `Heaven to a Tortured Mind` is the album that achieves the most out of this kind of sound.

  Release date: 2023-03-17

  [7.6/10]

## Dastardly Kids - Delinquent

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0675742390_16.jpg)

  Detroit hip-hop. The beats are quite nice, shame there's only fifteen minutes of it.

  Release date: 2023-01-27

  [7.6/10]

## Yaeji - With a Hammer

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2737c384818e82bff27e3fb0d88)

  I feel kind of similarto when I first heard Rina Sawayama's first full-length LP: they're both pretty good, but not really anywhere close to the EP that made me want to follow their discography. I just don't think it's as bombastic and catchy as the `What We Drew`.

  Release date: 2023-04-07

  [7.1/10]

## Fatima al Qadiri - Gumar

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0447014978_16.jpg)

  Minimal ambient-pop. Sprawling, suspensful middle eastern vibe.

  Release date: 2020-09-11

  [7.1/10]

## Chunky - Somebody's Child

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2650126951_16.jpg)

  UK rap. Not really feeling it...

  Release date: 2023-02-03

  [6.8/10]

## Patrick Shiroishi - Evergreen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1004227371_16.jpg)

  Ambient / field recording. To me this is much less focused than the marvellous `Hidemi` from 2021.

  Release date: 2021-05-14

  [6.7/10]

## Pile - All Fiction

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2802966857_10.jpg)

  I feel like they've been on a trajectory since `A Hair Shirt of Purpose` from noisy indie rock band that occasionally does insanely catchy but still very playful songs, to right now where they discard that dissonance to a large degree and focus more on Rick's vocal lines.

  Release date: 2023-02-17

  [6.6/10]

## Contact U - Dancing Inner Space, 1982 1984

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2483654921_16.jpg)

  Funk / dance. I can definitely recognize the sound on this LP from some records that I really like, but a record comprised of this and only this type of electronic funk is kind of numbing.

  Release date: 2022-03-30

  [6.6/10]

## Hedvig Mollestad Trio - Evil in Oslo

  ![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0409/4807/2609/products/37931_18_1000x.jpg?v=1592842567)

  Blues rock / stoner rock. Guitar tone is quite chunky but the virtuosity is just not there IMO.

  Release date: 2022-11-10

  [6.0/10]
