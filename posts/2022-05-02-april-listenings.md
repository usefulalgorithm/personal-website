## billy woods - Aethiopes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4190034538_16.jpg)

  This thing rips... I like his past projects but not nearly as much as I enjoy this one. Sparse and intensive at the same time? And the lines are crazy.

  Release date: 2022-04-08

  [9.0/10]

## Lizzy Mercier Descloux - Mambo Nassou

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273ce0c1ce5b0bcfc340c1f17f2)

  Funk fusion / post-punk. Got to know about this artist through a (review on Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/oki-tonkori-in-the-moonlight-review-ainu-people). Probably will check out other ZE Record artists as well.

  Release date: 1981

  This album is awesome.

  [8.8/10]

## Yage - 3 - 17 October 1984

  ![](https://cdn2.albumoftheyear.org/500x/album/413235-3-17-october-1984.jpg)

  ~_~ I really like screamo music ~_~

  Release date: 2000-03 

  [8.6/10]

## Violet - Transparências

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0108388476_16.jpg)

  Club / ambient. I like the ambient cuts a lot, like the first track `Música para acordar`, but the wonkier tracks on this album are also very fascinating.

  Release date: 2022-02-23

  [8.5/10]

## Nala Sinephro - Space 1.8

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2701684768_16.jpg)

  Great contemporary jazz. The last track sounds like Gas with sax on top. Totally missed out on this one last year...

  Release date: 2021-09-03

  [8.5/10]

## Pixel - The Drive

  ![](https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/7d/5c/88/mzi.zqorawqk.tif/1200x1200bf-60.jpg)

  Minimal electronic music from raster-noton. Normally when you see them publish something you should just check it out, chances are it's gonna be lit.

  Release date: 2021-10-15

  [8.5/10]

## Serwed - Serwed III

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0589142303_16.jpg)

  [Boomkat's review](https://boomkat.com/products/serwed-iii) is quite accurate: Chain Reaction + Huerco + Actress + Kuedo = this. Pretty good stuff.

  Release date: 2022-02-15

  [8.4/10]

## Oki - Tonkori In The Moonlight

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1480176306_16.jpg)

  The [Bandcamp page](https://oki-tonkori.bandcamp.com/album/tonkori-in-the-moonlight) will basically tell you everything you need to know about this project. As for me anything that comes from Oki's making is guaranteed to be quality stuff.

  Release date: 2022-02-04

  [8.3/10]

## Chat Pile - Remove Your Skin Please

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1074154568_16.jpg)

  It's like Godflesh meets Pissed Jeans meets The Body, but different from all of those bands at the same time. Looking forward to their new stuff.

  Release date: 2019-11-15

  [8.3/10]

## Booker Stardrum - CRATER

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2642949384_16.jpg)

  Abstract experimental electronic music from L.A. percussionist. Some of the sounds remind me of OPN's `Returnal`. The last track `Walking Through Still Air` is really nice.

  Release date: 2021-07-02

  [8.3/10]

## Patrick Shiroishi - Hidemi

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2008197316_16.jpg)

  Jazz concept album. Mesmerizing.

  Release date: 2021-10-29

  [8.2/10]

## Black Thought - Streams of Thought Vol. 1

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273aa3711fb2ed2e12a34bf1402)

  I think this is definitely better than Vol. 2... Conscious rap.

  Release date: 2018-06-01

  [8.1/10]

## Tangerine Dream - Raum

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4168858506_16.jpg)

  Cosmic synth ambient.

  Release date: 2022-02-24

  [8.0/10]

## Rex - Waltz

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273bda5c3db0bdc06ff829dd6ed)

  Slowcore / country. Like it a lot, if there's a band in Taiwan that plays this kind of stuff I'd go to every single one of their shows.

  Release date: 1996-03

  [8.0/10]

## Denzel Curry - Melt My Eyez See Your Future

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2735b924aa009b61b6b9d831eec)

  I never expected a jazz-hop album from him... Some featured guests don't really fit the tracks that well, but all in all this is quite an enjoyable album, and definitely a departure from his older, more abrasive style of music.

  Release date: 2022-03-25

  [8.0/10]

## ROSALÍA - MOTOMAMI

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2730c179967a265de0fc76382fe)

  Bombastic reggaeton.

  Release date: 2022-03-18

  [7.8/10]

## Ka Baird, Pekka Airaksinen - FRKWYS Vol. 17: Hungry Shells

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1513811650_16.jpg)

  Eerie experimental album. A bit difficult at first but gets better over repeated listening at work.

  Release date: 2021-10-22

  [7.8/10]

## FKA Twigs - Caprisongs

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/61d740b79a8903a73574e2a5/1:1/w_600/FKA-twigs-Caprisongs.jpg)

  Art pop. Nowadays it is hard to know when to call a musical project a full-length and when a mixtape... I actually think the featured artists on this album kind of don't fit in the muscial context, it'd be much nicer I think if there are less features and more of herself. Like the songwriting a lot.

  Release date: 2022-01-14

  [7.8/10]

## Ikarus - Plasma

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0841614421_16.jpg)

  Progressive jazz-rock, or just modern zeuhl. Jazzy stuff, didn't know there are still people making this kind of music.

  Release date: 2022-02-01

  [7.6/10]

## They Hate Change - Blatant Localism

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/797897/large/617308026665.jpg)

  I think their older tracks are much more fire than those three, when are they going to release a full length album though...

  Release date: 1981-07-01

  [7.5/10]

## Jeff Parker - Forfolks

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2972278449_16.jpg)

  Jazz guitar looping music.

  Release date: 2021-12-10

  [7.4/10]

## Benny The Butcher - Tana Talk 4

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/6228f7581ab90af188bbf44b/1:1/w_600/Benny-the-Butcher-Tana-Talk-4.jpeg)

  Quite enjoyable east coast hip-hop, but doesn't really push the envelop.

  Release date: 2022-03-11

  [7.4/10]

## Tomas Fujiwara's Triple Double - March

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0427953711_16.jpg)

  Free jazz.

  Release date: 2018-05-18

  [7.3/10]

## Soul Glo - Diaspora Problems

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3168552135_16.jpg)

  Hardcore punk + rap... Hardcore rap?? Pretty fun stuff.

  Release date: 2022-03-25

  [7.2/10]

## Saga Asad - New Man

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3493974522_16.jpg)

  Pretty smooth jazz-hop.

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [7.1/10]

## Teller Bank$, Ed Glorious - The Part & Parcel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1685381528_16.jpg)

  Boom bap.

  Release date: 2021-11-11

  [7.1/10]

## The Silver - Ward of Roses

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3370981599_16.jpg)

  Alright black metal. The tones are pretty decent, but in terms of songwriting it isn't exactly what I'd call innovative or refreshing.

  Release date: 2021-10-15

  [7.0/10]

## Haru Nemuri - Shunka Ryougen

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/62606c64f6f2bfbb8b696a75/1:1/w_600/Haru-Nemuri.jpeg)

  J-rock meets spoken words-ish rapping with occasional hardcore screams.

  Release date: 2022-04-22

  [6.5/10]

## SeeYouSpaceCowboy - The Romance of Affliction

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0558194352_16.jpg)

  And I thought everyone stopped doing pop metalcore a long time ago...

  Release date: 2021-11-05

  [4.0/10]
