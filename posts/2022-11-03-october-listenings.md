## Mamaleek - Diner Coffee

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0957239885_16.jpg)

  Noir-jazz meets sludge metal. This is a strong year for The Flenser for sure. `Come and See` from two years ago was one of my favorite albums from that year, and this tops that.

  Release date: 2022-09-30

  [8.8/10]

## Nobukazu Takemura - Hoshi No Koe

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2434490830_16.jpg)

  Glitchy ambient, kind of like Susumu Yokota. I enjoy this very much.

  Release date: 2001-03-20

  [8.6/10]

## Jigen - Blood's Finality

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0408899137_16.jpg)

  Chopped-up techno / drum & bass. This is very dope...

  Release date: 2022-09-27

  [8.5/10]

## quiqui - もう少しの暦

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1675563382_16.jpg)

  IMO they're the most overlooked band in Japan, super dope skramz.

  Release date: 2021-11-26

  [8.5/10]

## Loraine James - Build Something Beautiful for Me

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2913304085_16.jpg)

  Probably her most accessible work to date.

  Release date: 2022-10-07

  [8.4/10]

## Steve Bates - All the Things That Happen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2663050430_16.jpg)

  Fuzzy droning ambient / noise. Very immersive music, I like it a lot. 

  Release date: 2022-09-23

  [8.4/10]

## Mister Water Wet - Significant Soil

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2117289870_16.jpg)

  Ambient (from afro-cuban jazz ambient, to illbient, to field recordig). This is a lot of fun to listen to.

  Release date: 2022-08-22

  [8.3/10]

## Hattori Takashi - Moon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3856115128_16.jpg)

  Somehow I thought about video game soundtracks a lot when I was listening to this album... Psyched out experimental new age?

  Release date: 2015-11-13

  [8.3/10]

## T. Gowdy - Miracles

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0850045826_16.jpg)

  IDM. Or as Boomkat puts it post-techno. Dig the sounds in this album.

  Release date: 2022-09-08

  [8.2/10]

## Ian William Craig - Music for Magnesium 173

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3569106764_16.jpg)

  Man I gotta play the game.

  Release date: 2022-09-23

  [8.1/10]

## Lightning in a Twilight Hour - Overwintering

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4119177453_16.jpg)

  Soothing indie-folk / dream-pop.

  Release date: 2022-04-01

  [8.1/10]

## billy woods - Church

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0173383682_16.jpg)

  Not as groundbreaking as `Aethiopes`, but the sick bars are still here.

  Release date: 2022-09-30

  [8.0/10]

## Tarotplane - Aeonium

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1504159902_16.jpg)

  Psychedelic synth ambient. Not as impactful or fun as last year's `Horizontology` (love that one soooo much).

  Release date: 2022-09-22

  [7.8/10]

## Cult of Luna - The Long Road North

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4229333320_16.jpg)

  I think CoL is one of those bands that I don't really expect nor follow closely, but when I stumble upon their new stuff it's always something pretty good...

  Release date: 2022-02-11

  [7.8/10]

## Om Unit - Acid Dub Studies

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1148596880_16.jpg)

  I feel like Vol. 2 is more exciting than this one. Maybe because they've studied more?

  Release date: 2022-09-02

  [7.7/10]

## City of Caterpillar - Mystic Sisters

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2738d6add46435825a4a4736437)

  After 20 something years the screamo legends decide to do it one more time. This is not as amazing as their full-length album, but it's one that makes me expect whatever they're gonna do next.

  Release date: 2022-09-30

  [7.6/10]

## Iota Phi - Homo Pauperis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1518634432_16.jpg)

  Art-pop with dystopian lyrical themes. Quite enjoyable, but not especially memorable...

  Release date: 2022-09-28

  [7.6/10]

## Sam Prekop, John McEntire - Sons Of

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2022675075_16.jpg)

  Duo of former The Sea & Cake bandmates do a house record. Pretty fun to listen to but probably not something I'd revisit.

  Release date: 2022-07-22

  [7.4/10]

## Makaya McCraven - In These Times

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3992958598_16.jpg)

  Modern nu-jazz / fusion. Got vibes but personally not really that exciting...

  Release date: 2022-09-23

  [7.4/10]

## Liturgy - As the Blood of God Bursts the Veins of Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1585766490_16.jpg)

  There are heavy, groovy riffs here and there but overall this is stuff that makes you feel like you kind of wish Greg Fox is still on the squad...

  Release date: 2022-10-05

  [7.3/10]

## Arctic Monkey - The Car

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27307823ee6237208c835802663)

  If you can hear disappointing this is it.

  Release date: 2022-10-21

  [4.5/10]

## The Mars Volta - The Mars Volta

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273b491788f3f3bbae0db5763b9)

  The greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment......

  Release date: 2022-09-16

  [3.0/10]
