## Coby Sey - Conduit

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0974931449_16.jpg)

  Trip-hop. Or as he said it himself, post-grime? I'm not really that familiar (nor really a fan) of grime music though...

  Release date: 2022-09-09

  [8.6/10]

## Valentina Magaletti - A Queer Anthology of Drums

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2409308596_16.jpg)

  This stuff is pretty good... improvised percussion music. While extremely minimalistic there's still a very strong sense of structure in the songs. It is very avant-garde but not at all hard to follow.

  Release date: 2022-05-27

  [8.5/10]

## Patricia Wolf - See Through

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3705758829_16.jpg)

  Brooding synth ambient. Immersive.

  Release date: 2022-05-13

  [8.4/10]

## JID - The Forever Story

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736de37e432e720323f4e31edc)

  Another killer release from JID. Really dig the way he raps.

  Release date: 2022-08-26

  [8.4/10]

## Time Wharp - Spiro World

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1971162551_16.jpg)

  It's like Tortoise meets Jaga Jazzist. I dig this.

  Release date: 2022-06-17

  [8.3/10]

## Kali Malone - Living Touch

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4077013277_16.jpg)

  Kali Malone is still killer.

  Release date: 2022-07-08

  [8.3/10]

## Om Unit - Acid Dub Studies II

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1279450667_16.jpg)

  Gotta love me some quality dub techno that leans much more on the dub side than the techno side.

  Release date: 2022-09-02

  [8.2/10]

## Cucina Povera, Ben Vince - There I See Everything

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0700565065_16.jpg)

  Calm, sad ambient. This might be my favorite Cucina Povera release yet.

  Release date: 2022-08-05

  [8.0/10]

## Picnic - Creaky Little Branch

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2206632198_16.jpg)

  While this is still pretty good I still prefer last year's very awesome self-titled album to this one. The latter feels more like incidental music, and that's kind of what made it so interesting and engaging. The songs on this one is a lot more comforting, and the overall sound is more familiar. Still pretty good though.

  Release date: 2022-09-14

  [7.8/10]

## Svaneborg Kardyb - Knob

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2499948007_16.jpg)

  Maybe it's just me but I feel like a lot of Nordic jazz bands remind me a lot of Jaga Jazzist... pretty neat jazz music.

  Release date: 2015-11-13

  [7.6/10]

## Sam Gendel - Superstore

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0297013044_16.jpg)

  Humorous modern jazz. This is pretty fun stuff, none of the songs really stand out but it's quite coherent overall.

  Release date: 2022-06-10

  [7.5/10]

## Pariah - Caterpillar

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0737896101_16.jpg)

  Upbeat dance techno. Sounds alright, doesn't really click for me.

  Release date: 2022-06-17

  [7.2/10]

## Codeine - Dessau

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1762213724_16.jpg)

  Slowcore giant's sophomore album from 30 years ago just got unerathed and released. To be honest I am never really that into Codeine's stuff - they're not as emo as Red House Painters or cool as Duster. One thing for certain is that this one feels much more angular than `Frigid Stars`, but it's not like this release will change my opinion on them or anything... Maybe I should listen to `The White Birch`?

  Release date: 2022-09-02

  [7.2/10]

## Fontaines D.C. - Skinty Fia

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2470443209_16.jpg)

  Not as majestic as `A Hero's Death`.

  Release date: 2022-04-22

  [7.1/10]

## Vladislav Delay, Eivind Aarest - Singles

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4066521937_16.jpg)

  Grinding noise that kind of inherits the raw, slow burning energy of Vladislav Delay's `Rakka` series and `Isoviha`, but combined with more ambient elements and at a more galacial pace. I don't dislike it but I find this one a bit lacking in terms of highlights.

  Release date: 2014-03-24

  [7.0/10]

## 700 Bliss - 700 Bliss

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3614686902_16.jpg)

  Experimental hip-hop. I like Moor Mother a lot but while this is pretty fun to listen to (lots of self referential humor), it does not really have that moving power that's usually present on Moor Mother's albums...

  Release date: 2022-05-27

  [7.0/10]

## Grace Ives - Janky Star

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/176612223,1v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Vintage voice meets modern pop music production. I'm kinda indifferent to this one...

  Release date: 2022-06-10

  [7.0/10]

## Yaya Bey - Remember Your North Star

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1660335418_16.jpg)

  Jazzy R&B / hip-hop. I dunno, the lyrical theme is about something I'm very interested in but the music just does not feel all that interesting, and I was not really paying a lot of attention whenever I decided maybe I should give this a more serious listen...

  Release date: 2022-06-17

  [6.8/10]

## Tomu DJ - Half Moon Bay

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3107082408_16.jpg)

  Chill, uplifting, enjoyable but actually kinda forgettable club techno.

  Release date: 2022-08-12

  [6.7/10]

## salute - Ultra Pool

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0315675971_16.jpg)

  Dancehall friendly, super glossy, rather annoying club house music.

  Release date: 2022-08-25

  [6.3/10]
