  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/26100153,2v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Weird spoken-word / jazz-hop by two Japanese middle aged men. One of them played in Cowboy Bebop's OST and Ground Zero, the other is a columnist and (I think) a visiting scholar in Keio university. Really weird stuff, but in the best way possible.
