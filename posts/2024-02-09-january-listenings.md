  ![](https://i.discogs.com/fdXbIFvsJ3UZWfGuL0cSOfaDr0pQ7kR--rYHKJwQ4jQ/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:492/w:500/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTg5NTM0/LTE0ODM1Mzk5Njgt/NTMxMy5qcGVn.jpeg)

  Everything I love on `Hex`, condensed into a single track and then played in reverse.

  Release date: 2017-08-11

  [8.7/10]

## Astrid Sonne - Great Doubt

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0636007346_16.jpg)

  Left field experimental indietronica. This is even better than her last album, more quirky sounds and just more interesting.

  Release date: 2024-01-26

  [8.7/10]

## Bondo - Print Selections

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0193677783_16.jpg)

  Post-rock / post-hardcore. I really love stuff like this, slow paced guitar music with wonky dissonant melodies.

  Release date: 2023-02-24

  [8.5/10]

## Bianca Scout - The Heart of the Anchoress

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2363739212_16.jpg)

  Haunting hypnagogic pop.

  Release date: 2023-01-20

  [8.4/10]

## Tujiko Noriko - Crépuscule I & II

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3661845306_16.jpg)

  2 hours of ambient awesomeness.

  Release date: 2023-01-13

  [8.3/10]

## Unsung - Hand Painted Model Trains

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2185546852_16.jpg)

  Conscious hip-hop. The writing is straight up poetry.

  Release date: 2023-07-31

  [8.3/10]

## Wata Igarashi - Agartha

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3271359899_16.jpg)

  Psyched-out kraut-tronica / techno. FFO Gas and Caterina Barbieri.

  Release date: 2023-05-26

  [8.2/10]

## Purelink - Signs

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2058555088_16.jpg)

  Ambient / dub techno. Love stuff like this.

  Release date: 2023-09-15

  [8.2/10]

## Voice Actor - Fake Sleep

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3987835288_16.jpg)

  Hypnagogic pop. It's pretty good.

  Release date: 2023-10-10

  [8.0/10]

## DJ Danifox - Ansiedade

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2017712773_16.jpg)

  Afro-Portuguese club music, but more downtempo then the other artists. Pretty sure the Taipei techno audience would dig any Príncipe artist's stuff.

  Release date: 2023-04-26

  [7.8/10]

## betcover!! - 馬

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2739869cbb168612789b93444dc)

  Noisy indie jazz-rock. Kind of like Tokyo Jihen with more hair?

  Release date: 2023-10-17

  [7.8/10]

## Fabiano do Nascimento, Sam Gendel - The Room

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3455162830_16.jpg)

  Folky jazz music. Not bad, I love Fabiano do Nascimento's tasteful guitar playing.

  Release date: 2023-06-30

  [7.5/10]

## ML Buch - Suntub

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1117491203_16.jpg)

  Glistening dream-pop.

  Release date: 2023-10-27

  [7.4/10]

## Fatboi Sharif - Decay

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2828293936_16.jpg)

  Trippy alternative hip-hop. The instrumentals don't really do it for me.

  Release date: 2023-07-21

  [7.4/10]

## Natural Beauty Wonder Concept - Natural Beauty Wonder Concept

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0499254614_16.jpg)

  Downtempo / ambient. I still think there's more things DJ Python could do than this.

  Release date: 2023-07-14

  [7.2/10]

## Tara Clerkin Trio - On the Turning Ground

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0972796043_16.jpg)

  It's like mellowed out Stereolab. Pretty good but not as great as their full length LP from two years ago.

  Release date: 2023-11-03

  [7.0/10]

## LITE - Strata

  ![](https://www.sputnikmusic.com/images/albums/484532.jpg)

  This one’s more hip-hop influenced, but not in an interesting way. Their old stuff is vastly superior compared to this one. Still better than Toe's more recent stuff though...

  Release date: 2024-01-31

  [6.0/10]

## Föllakzoid - V

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2975563703_16.jpg)

  Lackluster trance techno. Is repeating an uninteresting pattern considered krautrock-ish nowadays?

  Release date: 2023-10-21

  [5.8/10]
