### Shame - Drunk Tank Pink

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1778017841_16.jpg)

  I feel like I've been listening to way too much punk music in January...

  Release date: 2021-01-15

  [8.2/10]

### Viagra Boys - Welfare Jazz

  ![](https://theartsdesk.com/sites/default/files/mastimages/viagra.jpg)

  Post-punk + sassy jazz sax. Songs are alright, lyrics sounds kinda meta-ish but that's fine by me.

  Release date: 2021-01-08

  [8.1/10]

### Ed Balloon - I Hate It Here

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3092409783_16.jpg)

  This one is more experimental and noisy than his 2018 album, which I like very much. This one contains more element of electronic music, and while the tracks are all pretty solid I do wish this is a full length album rather than a 10-minute EP.

  Release date: 2020-05-26

  [8.1/10]

### Various Artists - Virtual Dreams: Ambient Explorations In The House & Techno Age, 1993-1997

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2481278726_16.jpg)

  Lots of bangers in this one.

  Release date: 2020-12-14

  [8.0/10]

### R.A.P. Ferreira, Scallops Hotel - Bob's Son

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0738960096_16.jpg)

  It's OK

  Release date: 2021-01-01

  [7.6/10]

### Portrayal Of Guilt - Garden Of Despair

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2229746778_16.jpg)

  Blackened screamo. I don't question their musicianship one bit, but this is their most self-repeating release to date.

  Release date: 2021-01-06

  [6.2/10]

### (G)I-DLE - I Burn

  ![](https://image.bugsm.co.kr/album/images/1000/40240/4024084.jpg)

  K-pop. Make no mistake this is an album that still very much fit in the K-pop musical mold, but this one somehow is less annoying...

  Release date: 

  [6.1/10]

### Holly Childs & Gediminas Žygus - Hydrangea

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3255552807_10.jpg)

  Modern composition / spoken word. Very good vaporwave-y music, like something James Ferraro might do.

  Release date: 2018-07-03

  [8.7/10]

### Jabu - Sweet Company

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1268063597_10.jpg)

  Hypnagogic pop. 喔這很好聽

  Release date: 2020-04-07

  [8.4/10]

### Xyla - Ways

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0138336818_10.jpg)

  Techno + IDM + footwork. Ｑ彈電音，讚

  Release date: 2006-01-01

  [8.4/10]

### Christoph De Babalon - Recurring Horrors

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2207075376_16.jpg)

  Drum & Bass / sprawling electronic music. Totally missed this bad boy last year...

  Release date: 2020-10-16

  [8.4/10]

### Serpente - Fe / Vazio

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0801417094_10.jpg)

  Jungle + IDM. Groovy stuff, 張揚表示不錯聽

  Release date: 

  [8.4/10]

### Various Artists - Alterity

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4229211258_10.jpg)

  Gabber / trance techno. The concept surrounding this project is super nerdy almost to the extent of pretentiousness, but the tracks are really fun and stimulating. But then philosophizing = sexy is a long gone fad...

  Release date: 2020-09-11

  [8.4/10]

### 青葉市子 - Windswept Adan

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2741010406_10.jpg)

  Indie / psychedelic folk. Shifting chord progressions, ethereal vocals and crystalline plucked guitar, what's not to like...

  Release date: 2020-12-02

  [8.3/10]

### Michalis Moschoutis - Classical Mechanics

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1571756739_10.jpg)

  Modern composition / ambient / field recording. Music to listen to when you're alone.

  Release date: 

  [8.3/10]

### Hideki Umezawa - Andrew Peklar - Two Views Of Amami Oshima

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1125457222_16.jpg)

  Mystical ambient. Love this stuff.

  Release date: 

  [8.3/10]

### Leila - Like Weather

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1255524799_16.jpg)

  Downtempo / trip-hop. Sounds alright.

  Release date: 2020-11-20

  [7.9/10]

### Jessy Lanza - All The Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3307067049_16.jpg)

  Retro-pop. Wife seems to like this one a lot.

  Release date: 2013-01-01

  [7.8/10]

### Ill Considered - Ill Considered VIII

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3407957639_16.jpg)

### Robbie Basho - Selections From Song Of The Avatars: The Lost Master Tapes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2505370611_16.jpg)

  Ragtime.

  [7.7/10]

### Twins - Soon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1551146331_16.jpg)

  Mathy screamo. Like a mathier La Dispute.

  Release date: 2006-12-06

  [7.5/10]

### Moor Mother, billy woods - Brass

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2253407346_16.jpg)

  This feels more like a billy woods album with cameo appearance from Moor Mother than a collaberation between them. The tracks are alright but not as good as what I expected it to be.

  Release date: 2021-06-10

  [7.2/10]

### Repetitor - Prazan prostor među nama koji može i da ne postoji

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3647542142_10.jpg)

  Serbian punk band. Sometimes the guitar sounds pretty cool, but other times not so much. The vocals are less cool than the guitars.

  Release date: 2020-11-20

   [6.7/10]

### Primitive Ignorant - Sikh Punk

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3522276063_16.jpg)

  Industrial pop / gothic. I feel like this sounds a lot like NIN and Marilyn Manson, and I am really not a fan of MM...

  Release date: 

  [6.4/10]

### The Golden Filter - Autonomy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0304938507_16.jpg)

  Darkwave. Pretty doomy stuff, fans of Fabulous Diamonds or Telefon Tel Aviv will enjoy this.

  Release date: 2020-10-30

  [7.8/10]

### Omni - Deluxe

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2690277979_16.jpg)

  Post-punk revival stuff. Pretty jangly, not really impressionable to me. Or I just don't like this kind of post-punk sound a lot...

  Release date: 2017-03-03

  [6.9/10]
