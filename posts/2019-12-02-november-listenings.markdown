## 2019 Releases

### Grischa Lichtenberger - Re:Phgrp

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3672540726_10.jpg)

  What is this... IDM with dissonant jazz samples? Free jazztronica? Deconstructed glitch jazz?

  [8.8/10]

### Jenny Hval - The Practice Of Love

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1356483119_10.jpg)

  Experimental indie art pop. The instrumentals are very techno-ish and has a bunch of four-on-the-floor beats going on, while Jenny Hval's voice is as ethereal as ever. Do not miss out.

  [8.6/10]

### FKA Twigs - Magdalene

  ![](https://images.genius.com/22137811fba80fb115438ebb3e0ef365.1000x1000x1.jpg)

  Don't like the Future feature on this album. Other than that every song is pretty good. I think I actually enjoy this one more than her earlier albums...

  [8.6/10]

### Uniform & The Body - Everything That Dies Someday Comes Back

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1452803260_10.jpg)

  ..............................

  [8.5/10]

### Joy Orbison - Slipping

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1830492759_10.jpg)

  Dope UK club EP. Definitely check out Breathe In and Walworth Waltz.

  [8.5/10]

### Special Request - Bedroom Tapes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3988140470_10.jpg)

  What's up with this dude? Another awesome post-IDM album from the group that put out Vortex, another awesome album, earlier this year.

  [8.5/10]

### Imaginary Softwoods - Gold Fiction Loop Garden

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4265072499_10.jpg)

  Synth-laden ambient music.

  [8.4/10]

### Various Artists - EQUIPMENT

  ![](http://www.st.rim.or.jp/~chainon/gif_f/cd_g_f/eqp.gif)

  I'm a sucker for Japanese ambient new age music... This is like the background music for Legend of Zelda games, but without the actual game distracting you from really getting absorbed by the music.

  [8.3/10]

### Andy Stott - It Should Be Us

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/622025/large/Cover.jpg)

  Haven't listened to Andy Stott's stuff in a long time... Slow, dark, twisted techno / house music. 0L9, Take, Versi and Dismantle are great tracks.

  [8.3/10]

### Liturgy - H.A.Q.Q.

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2767654837_10.jpg)

  Not as magnificent as Aesthethica, but still kicks ass. The band kind of returns to a more black metal inspired sound on this album. Some songs have weird, almost funny metal parts where the guitars play syncopated chugs and the drums just blast away, and it's these parts that kind of worries me if the day when djent black metal becomes a legit subgenre has finally come. Other than that I think most of the other heavier metal sections are carried out wonderfully, like the song God of Love - it's gotta be one of my favorite metal jams in 2019. I also enjoy the more mellowed out, modern classical-ish interludes on this album.

  [8.3/10]

### A Winged Victory For The Sullen - The Undivided Five

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3702110673_10.jpg)

  Very soothing piano neoclassical / ambient. Great to put on repeat on a sleep deprived workday...

  [8.2/10]

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4201403549_10.jpg)

  Kinda like the cheerier songs on Selected Ambient Works Vol.2. Or Mount Kimbie. Or Four Tet.

  [8.2/10]

### Blood Incantation - Hidden History Of The Human Race

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0485761639_10.jpg)

  Ass-kicking death metal. Actually pretty catchy. That last track is pretty post-metal-ish and super epic. Dig it!

  [8.2/10]

### Drab Majesty - Modern Mirror

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4190738787_10.jpg)

  Has the moment when dark, gothic, Cabaret Voltaire inspired post-punk bands become once again championed by music dorkish reviewers on the Internet, i.e. yours truly, since forever finally arrived? Probably. I like this a lot more than I like the Strokes, the National and the Horror, or all these post-punk revival bands combined.

  [8.1/10]

### Planetary Assault Systems - Plantae

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3615695996_10.jpg)

  A pretty banger techno album. Bandcamp introduction says Luke Slater is "an innovator of psychedelic mindfuck techno". Quite fitting IMO.

  [8.1/10]

### Sunn O))) - Pyroclasts

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0470628539_10.jpg)

  TFW Sunn O))) went Yo La Tango.

  [8.1/10]

### Jessica Pratt - Quiet Signs

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3502216320_10.jpg)

  Short and sweet folk album. Jessica Pratt has an interesting voice. I enjoy the stripped-down production on this album.

  [8.0/10]

### Tune Of Negation, Shackleton - Reach The Endless Sea

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3119923355_10.jpg)

  I'm not familiar with Shackleton's earlier stuff... I thought he was known to be doing dark dubstep inspired electronica? Anyway this album is very vibrant and organic. I like how there are a lot of acoustic instruments featured on this album, the kalimbas, organs and vibraphones are very prominent and contribute a lot to the overall organic feel of this project. Also I suspect the Japanese ambient scene has a pretty deep influence on this album.

  [8.0/10]

### Hand Habits - Placeholder

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2333065947_10.jpg)

  Pretty rockin' indie rock. The guitar solos on this album kick a lot of asses.

  [7.9/10]

### DEBBY FRIDAY - DEATH DRIVE

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1633806476_10.jpg)

  Short and powerful industrial experimental hip hop (can't think of a better description... think clipping. and Chino Amobi and the likes).

  [7.9/10]

### Young Marco - Bahasa

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0636059926_10.jpg)

  Intriguing ambient techno with heavy Bali references. Sounds somewhere between meditative and festive.

  [7.9/10]

### Cate Le Bon - Reward

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1051581971_10.jpg)

  Art indie pop. There are moments where it sounds very similar to Stereolab's stuff, but not as lush.

  [7.8/10]

### E-Saggila - My World My Way

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3544291921_10.jpg)

  Fast and hard industrial techno. Pretty gnarly.

  [7.8/10]

### Not Waving, Dark Mark - Downwelling

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3502216320_10.jpg)

  I dig this way more than I dig Mark Lanegan's own stuff. Mark's voice has a raw, carefree quality to it, yet when paired with the restrained instrumentals from Not Waving it makes a bizarrely compelling combination. The last song is very good.

  [7.8/10]

### Lapalux - Amnioverse

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0924488326_10.jpg)

  Pretty decent IDM record. Not too challenging or groundbreaking, but does everything quite well, a well-balanced album. Some of the ambient parts of this record are pretty post-rock like, but they don't overindulge like the run-of-the-mill post rock bands do. I like the track Thin Air a lot. JFDR's solo album from 2017 is dope too.

  [7.8/10]

### Swans - leaving meaning.

  ![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0397/1609/products/chipboard_YG63_grande.jpg?v=1571438771)

  The music sounds pretty much like reiterations and / or continuations of Swans' previous albums. There are indeed interesting moments on this album, like tracks Sunfucker and Annaline, but all in all there really isn't a departure from the Michael Gira sound in the older albums, despite a whole new lineup of massively talented musicians.

  [7.7/10]

### Kim Gordon - No Home Record

  ![](https://store.matadorrecords.com/media/catalog/product/cache/4/image/500x/85e4522595efc69f496374d01ef2bf13/k/i/kimgordon_nohomerecord.jpg)

  Kim Gordon tries trap rap... and succeeds. Abrasive. There are still some indie rock tracks on this album, and although they're not really as experimental as, say, Sonic Youth's stuff that are laden with insane guitar tunings and absurd song structures, they do hold their own and are pretty enjoyable.

  [7.7/10]

### Devendra Banhart - Ma

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2002100258_10.jpg)

  Though I still prefer Mala to this album, it doesn't mean this album is not good or anything. Devendra Banhart has a great voice and a good grasp of writing songs that are fun and catchy. Warm and loving indie folk. And the Vashti Bunyan featured track is awesome.

  [7.7/10]

### Michael Vincent Waller - Moments

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3154283276_10.jpg)

  Sentimental piano music. The Nocturnes and Love suite are highlights on this album.

  [7.6/10]

### Project Pablo - Sofware

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0940380732_10.jpg)

  Uplifting club music.

  [7.5/10]

### Lori Goldston - Things Opening

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0117975417_10.jpg)

  Interesting modern classical solo cello album. Some songs sound pretty bluesy.

  [7.3/10]

### Kindohm - Meme Booth

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/620495/large/CON027.jpg)

  Futuristic glitchy techno / dance. Dude used TidalCycle to make this album, so that's pretty cool.

  [7.2/10]

### Ondness - Not Really Now Not Any More

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2148205070_10.jpg)

  Pretty cool deconstructed techno music. The songs are very sparse and can sometimes feel a bit too random.

  [7.3/10]

### Various Artists - Cairo Concepts

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2829425510_10.jpg)

  Intriguing Egyptian dance music compilation. Mahraganat it is called, I'd say it's Arabic grime / dance music. Not really a fan of this type of music though.

  [7.1/10]

### Fly Pan Am - C’est ça

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2782215947_10.jpg)

  Mellow Deafheaven... or black metal inspired vocals and drums on tripping post-rock-ish instrumentals and droning synths. Check the last song and don't tell me you haven't heard this beat on some other black metal albums.

  [7.0/10]

### Pinkish Black - Concept Unification

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3800203582_10.jpg)

  Sludgy doom metal with shoegaze vocals. Not bad but not that good either.

  [6.8/10]

### Torche - Admission

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3181089603_10.jpg)

  Red Fang playing punk rock with Failure's vocal. Pretty lackluster...

  [6.4/10]

### 9m88 - 平庸之上

  ![](https://yuebeifan.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/9m88.jpg?w=1050&h=)

  The band is killing it. 9m88 isn't. I guess having a very spectacular crew of musicians to accompany an artist does have one drawback: it would be very easy to tell if the artist isn't as good as their hired musicians. If there ever is an instrumental version of this I'd definitely get a copy. 9m88 本人蠻平庸的，樂手老師倒是真的很強

  [6.1/10]

### Alcest - Spiritual Instinct

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3962441999_10.jpg)

  IMO only Agalloch can do this kind of post-black metal stuff correctly.

  [6.0/10]

### Varials - In Darkness

  ![](https://new-transcendence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Indark2.jpg)

  Pretty average metalcore. I was looking for something like Vein and this is totally not it... cut me some slack with those monotonous breakdowns will ya

  [5.9/10]

### 老王樂隊 - 吾日三省吾身

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/64220449,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  I don't like this album at all... I tried not to be overly skeptical and went through the entire album, but I couldn't help finding a lot of faults on this thing. The more rock oriented songs on this album sound like poorly done 80's hard rock with cringeworthy guitar solos, and then there are folky slower songs, which probably were intended to appeal to a wider audience but just ended up sounding pretty cheesy and bland. One of the lowlights has got to be the vocals. I have a feeling that the vocalist was trying to showcase the versatility of his vocal abilities, but in the end it only made the songs even more insufferable. And it's not even that difficult to figure that the lyrics are just as embarrassing as all the other aspects of the album... 破產版昏鴉

  [4.5/10]

## Non-2019 Releases

### Rodan - Hat Factory '93

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1479464799_10.jpg)

  [9.5/10]

### Labradford - Labradford

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1778999598_10.jpg)

  Labradford is one of the forerunners of ASMR music. Seriously.

  [9.1/10]

### H. Takahashi - Low Power

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1280258474_10.jpg)

  Dude makes way better music with GarageBand on his iPhone while on his way to work than me, usually sitting in front of the laptop trying to conjure up a cool guitar riff for hours and end up sounding like Incubus.

  [8.8/10]

### Porter Ricks - Biokinetics

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/141544/large/original.jpg)

  Superb ambient / techno.

  [8.6/10]

### AGF - A Deep Mysterious Tone

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1890446529_10.jpg)

  Exquisite experimental electronic music.

  [8.5/10]

### Yoshiaki Ochi - Natural Sonic

  ![](https://i2.wp.com/www.fondsound.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Natural-Sonic.jpg?w=600&ssl=1)

  Organic Japanese ambient music. Not sure if people actually call this kind of music "environmental ambient"... The artist incorporated many different percussion elements into this album, there's even a song when he's hitting the water and the little pebbles. Very interesting record and definitely recommended for those who like Japanese new age music.

  [8.4/10]

### Shiho Yabuki - The Body Is A Message Of The Universe

  ![](http://www.subliminalsounds.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sub-122-lp_jpeg_800px.jpg)

  Another Japanese new age record from before I was born, this one has some cuts that sound darker and more bizarre, which is nice.

  [8.4/10]

### Thuja - All Strange Beasts Of The Past

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/236531/large/original.jpg)

  The best comparison would be Jack Rose / Pelt. Prominent eastern psychedelic sound influences blended with weird Americana guitars. Like a dream when you know you're not entirely awake but couldn't tell if you're really dreaming. Good stuff.

  [8.3/10]

### Brain Eno - Apollo

  ![](https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brian-Eno-Apollo-Atmospheres-And-Soundtracks-Extended-Edition-packshot-820.jpg)

  Psyched-out ambient. I prefer Music For Airports' sound to this one, but it's still a pretty decent album nonetheless.

  [7.9/10]

### Pinkcourtesyphone - Indelicate Slices

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4122068721_10.jpg)

  Dark modern classical / ambient. Pretty mesmerizing. The song Above Chandeliers has a melody in the beginning of it that reminds me of the Windows XP startup sound.

  [7.9/10]

### Guzz - An Elephant In The Jungle

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0839264384_10.jpg)

  Bassy electronica with a lot of traditional instruments from the tropics. The title is actually quite fitting.

  [7.8/10]

### Jesus Piece - Only Self

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2985474853_10.jpg)

  Slamming metalcore. Nice...

  [7.6/10]

### Joseph Nothing - Dreamland Idle Orchestra

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/230445/large/original.jpg)

  Hard to imagine how Tatsuda Yoshiya always strives to try new stuff and then does it well. This album is from his own IDM project, while there are some songs that I feel are a bit too hyperactive, it is overall still a pretty neat album that perfectly incorporates some elements from Tatsuda's other musical projects, like funky slapped bass samples, proggy vocal samples and drum beats into a more choppy, Aphex Twin-ish electronica sound.

  [7.4/10]

### Mark Pritchard - Lock Off

  ![](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2013/warprecords-349.jpg)

  Jungle / hip hop. Danceable but doesn't really make a lot of impression.

  [7.2/10]

### Wiardon - Windbreaker Music

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0738780898_10.jpg)

  Delicate but forgettable instrumental hip hop mini album at just 18 minutes of playing time. I enjoy the beats but they're just too underdeveloped to be remembered. Hopefully the artist can translate the ideas explored on the album into more developed songs in their future projects.

  [7.0/10]

### Courtney Marie Andrews - May Your Kindness Remain

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4286792715_10.jpg)

  Sweet sounding country / americana album. I like her voice and the songwritings are pretty decent, but none of the songs actually stands out, at least to me.

  [6.8/10]
