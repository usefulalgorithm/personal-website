### Bing & Ruth - Species

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3322349797_10.jpg)

  Ambient on electric organ. Why is this so good...

  Release date: 2020-07-17

  [9.4/10]

### R.A.P. Ferreira - Purple Moonlight Pages

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3502677951_10.jpg)

  So this is actually milo after he changed his stage name because of Milo Yiannopoulos. Super dope jazz-hop. Can't imagine people hating on this record...

  Release date: 2020-03-06

  [9.0/10]

### Olan Monk - Love/Dead

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0059717039_10.jpg)

  Glitch gothic post-punk Scott Walker. On my second time listening to this I found that I actually like this one a lot.

  Release date: 2015-10-06

  [8.8/10]

### Blu & Exile - Miles

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1814921150_10.jpg)

  Awesome jazz-hop album.

  Release date: 2020-11-15

  [8.7/10]

### Jme - Grime MC

  ![](https://townsquare.media/site/838/files/2020/05/jme-grime-mc.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89)

  This month I've been listening to a bunch of grime music... this one is pretty hard hitting.

  Release date: 2020-06-01

  [8.6/10]

### Kassel Jaeger - Swamps/Things

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0643755344_10.jpg)

  Outstanding ambient album.

  Release date: 2020-07-10

  [8.5/10]

### Alva Noto - Xerrox, Vol. 4

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/659225/large/5057805471202.jpg)

  To me this is more like a Gas record than a Alva Noto one. I love Gas so that's fine by me.

  Release date: 2020-06-19

  [8.4/10]

### Speaker Music - Black Nationalist Sonic Weaponry

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1819018917_10.jpg)

  Theory-heavy techno. Really makes you think.

  Release date: 2020-11-27

  [8.4/10]

### Gabor Lazar - Source

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2041328271_10.jpg)

  Bouncy, electrifying IDM / techno.

  Release date: 2021-05-14

  [8.3/10]

### Mechatok - Defective Holiday OST

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2322763402_10.jpg)

  Fun ambient / IDM / progressive trance. This is the soundtrack to a... walking simulation game where the player goes on a virtual holiday that is glitchy AF? As weird as that sounds the music is exquisite stuff. Love this.

  Release date: 2020-05-20

  [8.3/10]

### Masaki Batoh - Smile Jesus Loves You

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2506772783_10.jpg)

  World / folk / psychedelic. Neat.

  Release date: 

  [8.3/10]

### JAF Trio - JAF Trio

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1385750709_10.jpg)

  Rising stars of contemporary jazz music. This reminds me of some older, more leftfield jazz records, while still maintaining an uplifting, almost UK electro-jazz-ish vibe.

  Release date: 2020-07-03

  [8.3/10]

### Bill Nace - Both

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2302910173_10.jpg)

  Noise / ambient / drone.

  Release date: 2018-03-09

  [8.2/10]

### тпсб - Whities 031

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0808530894_10.jpg)

  Kinda like drum & bass Coil.

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [8.2/10]

### Asher Gamedze - Dialectic Soul

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2422404092_10.jpg)

  This is the debut album of the drummer who played on Angel Bat Dawid's spectacular album from last year, The Oracle. I guess with that in mind it's easier to see where this one is going thematically... The first suite of the album, State Of Emergence Suite, is pretty haunting free jazz. The others have more vivid themes going on, the chord progressions are easier to get a grasp on and the grooves are more straightforward.

  Release date: 2020-07-10

  [8.2/10]

### Josey Rebelle - Josey In Space

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3238075294_10.jpg)

  Black dance music DJ mix. There's Loraine James and DJ Marcelle on this thing.

  Release date: 2020-05-15

  [8.2/10]

### Mohammad Reza Mortazavi, Burnt Friedman - Yek 2

  ![](https://nonplace.de/lib/2020/03/NON52_digital.jpg)

  Iranian percussive instrument called tombak plus trance IDM. Good stuff.

  Release date: 2020-06-12

  [8.1/10]

### Pinch - Reality Tunnels

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2416437851_10.jpg)

  UK bass / trip-hop. Vibrant.

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [8.1/10]

### Gia Margaret - Mia Gargaret

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0230377238_10.jpg)

  Warm, meditative ambient / piano music.

  Release date: 2020-06-12

  [8.1/10]

### Various Artists - Stimulus Swim

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3802937056_10.jpg)

  Club / footwork / experimental electronic music compilation. So this is the mixtape bunch of artists on Hyperdub made along with Adult Swim. The official Bandcamp says this would be a glimpse into what HD would release later this year, guess it's going to be pretty fire then.

  Release date: 

  [8.1/10]

### Croatian Amor - All In The Same Breath

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0672838377_10.jpg)

  IDM / ambient. While not as memorable and strong as Elephant, the album from Loke Rahbek and Frederik Valentin earlier this year and is a strong candidate for my AOTY, this one is nevertheless an pretty decent chillout record.

  Release date: 2020-06-19

  [8.0/10]

### Armand Hammer - Shrines

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3328934518_10.jpg)

  Pretty dope hip-hop. The lyrics are on point and the featured artists in this record are fire.

  Release date: 2012-07-23

  [8.0/10]

### Blawan - Immulsion

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3472139649_10.jpg)

  Pulsating industrial techno. Good stuff.

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [8.0/10]

### Phoebe Bridges - Punisher

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1836607637_10.jpg)

  Indie folk. I love the last track very much.

  Release date: 2020-06-18

  [7.9/10]

### Annanan, Space Afrika - LL.M. 002

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1423757603_10.jpg)

  Pulsating ambient techno.

  Release date: 2015-06-01

  [7.8/10]

### Arca - KiCk i

  ![](https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2020/06/arca-kick-i-1592319012-640x640.jpg)

  Avant-pop / glitch hop / experimental electro-pop? This is a lot more approachable than Arca's other stuff. I guess at times this feels a little too all over the place and distracting? Nevertheless the album still features several decent banger tracks, like Nonbinary and No Queda Nada. Also I'm willing to bet a beer on Grimes feeling more than a little regretful for the fact that instead of going for this kind of stuff she instead pulled off Miss Anthropocene... that album is wack.

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [7.8/10]

### Nazar - Guerrilla

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2577958090_10.jpg)

  So I still don't get what exactly the term Kuduro means... Quirky experimental club music. Nazar is son to an Angolan rebel general, and this album is kind of like an sonic exploration / exposition of the history of his entire family.

  Release date: 1999-07-27

  [7.8/10]

### Heather Leigh - Glory Days

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/670469/large/Cover.jpg)

  Electronic / ambient / field recording / folk. Weird stuff... this album is very difficult to categorize: the track Death Switch features ethereal folk guitar and birds chirping, two tracks later we get Take Just A Little, a electronica banger that's super easy to dance to, and then the next track Island is meditative ambient. If only every lockdown album is as good and adventurous as this one...

  Release date: 2016-11-18

  [7.7/10]

### Shinichi Atobe - Yes

  ![](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2020/dds042-shinichi-atobe.jpg)

  Melodic house mostly in major chords. I dig the more restrained dub techno vibe present in From The Heart, It's A Start, A Work Of Art, the record that introduced me to this dude, more than the melodic take of Chicago house music in this and his last release, Heat. Boomkat is quite accurate in saying this one showcases a very strong Drexciya influence, but then Drexciya albums are more fun and unpredictable than this one...

  Release date: 1997-03-25

  [7.6/10]

### 박혜진 Park Hye Jin - How Can I

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2078891847_10.jpg)

  Pop techno / dance. FFO Yaeji but this covers more genres.

  Release date: 2015-04-14

  [7.6/10]

### Shifted - The Dirt On Our Hands

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2505010224_10.jpg)

  Futuristic hard techno. FFO JK Flesh.

  Release date: 2020-06-08

  [7.6/10]

### Bolt Gun - Begotten

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0488022450_10.jpg)

  Does this have anything to do with the film with the same name... ambient / post-black metal. FFO Lantlôs I guess?

  Release date: 2019-02-15

  [7.6/10]

### Kemba - The World Is Watching

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2172802790_10.jpg)

  Contemporary political hip-hop. The hooks aren't my stuff but the last track really gets it. This is written in 2016... the fact that nothing has really changed between these four years is extremely sobering.

  Release date: 2020-06-25

  [7.5/10]

### Amnesia Scanner - Tearless

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2476340931_10.jpg)

  Experimental club / electronic music. I always thought AS stuff were all pretty chaotic and hard to get through, but this is not the case on this album. Lots of tracks on this album carry a strong Sega Bodega vibe, but not as pop-oriented. Not a fan of the album cover though... eww.

  Release date: 2020-06-19

  [7.5/10]

### Chloe x Halle - Ungodly Hour

  ![](https://weedynews.com/static/images/61/halle-bailey.png)

  R&B / pop. Songs like Busy Boy and Lonely are pretty dope, the others are just alright though.

  Release date: 2020-06-03

  [7.5/10]

### Illuminati Hotties - Free I.H: This Is Not The One You've Been Waiting For

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1280693923_10.jpg)

  Pretty refreshing indie punk, or "tenderpunk" as the singer / mastermind of this musical project calls it. Some quirky chords and vocals here and there but overall it's a bit too tamed for my likings.

  Release date: 2020-07-17

  [7.3/10]

### Sekwence - Essentials 2 (Purgatory)

  ![](https://e.snmc.io/i/600/w/58539c779d2aa59b938e8352832546d0/8001499)

  Chill-hop. I like the instrumentals a lot but not so much his voice.

  Release date: 

  [7.2/10]

### 100 Gecs - 1000 Gecs And The Tree Of Clues

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/80152114,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  I like this more than their highly acclaimed release from last year... hyperactive bipolar pop music.

  Release date: 2020-07-10

  [7.1/10]

### Jay Glass Dubs - Soma

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0185882726_10.jpg)

  IDM / trip-hop / dub techno (sometimes).

  Release date: 2013-09-17

  [7.0/10]

### Haim - Women In Music Pt. III

  ![](https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HAIM_WIMP3_10x10.jpg)

  Contemporary soft pop rock. People have been raving over this one... maybe this is the pinnacle of modern pop music? But I'm not really that into this one. Sure the songs are really well written, the instrumentations are intricate and the production is on point, but... I don't know, aren't good pop rock albums also being inherently boring and predictable? While this is indeed a very decent album it just doesn't grow on me.

  Release date: 2021-02-19

  [7.0/10]

### Vile Creature - Glory, Glory! Apathy Took Helm!

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4014851458_10.jpg)

  Sludge / doom metal. Pretty heavy, but the grooves are too steady for my taste.

  Release date: 2020-06-19

  [7.0/10]

### Hedvig Mollestad - Ekhidna

  ![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0409/4807/2609/products/37978_18_720x.jpg?v=1592842844)

  Psychedelic jazz fusion.

  Release date: 2020-07-03

  [7.0/10]

### Kamaal Williams - Wu Hen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3033305661_10.jpg)

  Jazz-funk / soul. Imma stick with Black Focus though.

  Release date: 2020-07-24

  [6.8/10]

### Early Adopted - Tarred & Feathered

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3957195206_10.jpg)

  Eminem-esque rap album. Not my jam though.

  Release date: 2020-04-03

  [6.7/10]

### Wire - 10:20

  ![](http://spillmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Wire.jpg)

  Old-school post-punk.

  Release date: 2019-11-29

  [6.5/10]

### The Streets - None Of Us Are Getting Out Of This Life Alive

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5f08db2d3145eda8a1c27922/1:1/w_600/None%20Of%20Us%20Are%20Getting%20Out%20Of%20This%20Life%20Alive_The%20Streets.jpg)

  His old stuff is better IMO. This one is more melodic and sort of strays away from the Grime sound, and has a bunch of big name features. But the lyrics don't seem to capture the raw energy prominent in A Grand Don't Come For Free and other older stuff. The more approachable uplifting songs like Falling Down sound as bland as it can get...

  Release date: 2020-07-10

  [6.3/10]

### Paysage D'Hiver - Im Wald

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0868412336_10.jpg)

  DSBM. Man this album is long... and I guess this kind of production, while having its historic significance, don't really do contemporary black metal justice: the ferocious drums and blistering guitars simply get drowned by the unnecessarily raw production.

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [6.2/10]

### Cotoba - Name Of The Seasons

  ![](https://www.koreanindie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cotoba-name-of-the-seasons.jpg)

  Korean math rock / pop. Think Elephant Gym but with more chops. Gets style points for the licks and rapid fire drumming but the riffs are pretty lackluster.

  Release date: 2020-06-30

  [6.0/10]

### Taylor Swift - Folklore

  ![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10BBB/production/_113593586_swift.jpg)

  Haim's new album is a much better attempt at making straight up pop album that does not suck. While this is without a doubt Swift's best effort so far, for me it's still pretty meh.

  Release date: 2020-07-24

  [5.5/10]

### Khurangbin - Mordechai

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0911513519_10.jpg)

  Unmemorable chill-out (not so) psychedelic music.

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [5.0/10]

### Hum - Inlet

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4126716193_10.jpg)

  I'd suggest sticking to Downward Is Heavenward.

  Release date: 2020-06-24

  [4.3/10]

### Cheriton - Parallel

  ![](https://atwoodmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Parallel-Single-580x580.jpg)

  No... dad rock is no longer stuff like Papa Roach or Hoobastank. Dad rock in 2020 is this. Cloying indie rock.

  Release date: 1978-09-23

  [3.0/10]

### Silvana Estrada, Charlie Hunter - Lo Sagrado

  ![](https://modernjazz.gr/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Silvana-Estrada.jpg)

  Awesome organic jazz-pop. 阿爆可惜了

  Release date: 2017-11-03

  [8.6/10]

### The Streets - A Grand Don't Come For Free

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5875e6ef95969320b0d/1:1/w_600/3748194f.jpg)

  I was super into Original Pirate Material and The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living when I was in high school while totally missing out on this one.

  Release date: 2004

  [8.5/10]

### Kevin Drumm - Shut In

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/77864/large/original.jpg)

  Drone ambient. Very slow and minimalistic, a radiating suite of 30 minutes. The artist seems like a huge black metal fan. Or maybe he plays in a black metal band? Anyway this is probably the best hangover music.

  Release date: 2017-05-01

  [8.5/10]

### Gia Margaret - There's Always Glimmer

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3789179044_10.jpg)

  Soothing indietronica / piano folk.

  Release date: 2019-05-24

  [8.3/10]

### Smerz - Have Fun

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/487812/large/191404088159_T38929977000054.jpg)

  Future-pop / trip-hop. She sounds like a more pop oriented version of Mhysa, which is pretty cool.

  Release date: 2021-06-09

  [8.2/10]

### Jonnine - Super Natural

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1483906682_10.jpg)

  Ambient electro-pop. At times this sounds kind of eerie, which is good.

  Release date: 2020-12-28

  [8.1/10]

### Sleaford Mods - Eton Alive

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/48467343,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  ... British punk-hop? I know they're a post-punk band but I think this one has a very strong hip-hop vibe going on. This is my first time listening to their stuff, safe to say I'm sold.

  Release date: 2019-02-22

  [8.0/10]

### Gesellschaft Zur Emanzipation Des Samples - Circulations

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2521348881_10.jpg)

  Obscure cut & paste electronic music from Jan Jelinek. This gravitates more towards sound collage territory.

  Release date: 2014-07-15

  [7.8/10]

### Black Ark Players - Black Ark In Dub

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/665650/large/181868.jpg)

  Reissued last month. Dub album from dub legend Lee "Scratch" Perry.

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [7.6/10]

### Ganser - You Must Be New Here

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0612857955_10.jpg)

  Indie rock / post-punk. Pretty awesome rock music.

  Release date: 

  [7.5/10]

### Lord Mantis - Universal Death Church

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1610251004_10.jpg)

  Not as vicious as their previous stuff.

  Release date: 2019-11-22

  [7.3/10]

### Anne Bakker - Vox/Viola

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3941594196_10.jpg)

  Classical indie pop?

  Release date: 2016-07-01

  [7.2/10]

### Ø - Kantamoinen

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/360912/large/BKEDIT013_Dist_Preview.jpg)

  Psychedelic, eerie ambient electronic music. Not my favorite among Mika Vainio's catalog though.

  Release date: 2005-05-18

  [7.0/10]

### Annette Brisset - Love Power

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/526561/large/R-12428563-1535110938-7979.jpeg.jpg)

  Happy sounding dub love songs.

  Release date: 1992-08-23

  [7.0/10]

### Karkait - Yekum // Kiyum

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2952926757_10.jpg)

  Black metal + punk rock? The songs are too short.

  Release date: 

  [6.2/10]

### Adoy - Vivid

  ![](https://www.koreanindie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/adoy-vivid.jpg)

  I can't finish this one... I just can't... Unoriginal lofi indie pop. Not for me. The production was pretty neat though.

  Release date: 2018-03-13

  [4.0/10]

### The Pom-Poms - I Was On The News

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2028847466_10.jpg)

  Trap-pop / dance pop. Yuck.

  Release date: 

  [3.0/10]
