## The Armed - Ultrapop

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3250444278_16.jpg)

  Noise rock (the highly enjoyable kind). Gorin! AOTY material.

  Release date: 2021-04-16

  [9.1/10]

## Susumu Yokota - Magic Thread

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3258085063_16.jpg)

  I always thought he only did ambient work, turns out this is a really decent minimal techno record... FFO Jan Jelinek.

  Release date: 1998-01-07

  [8.8/10]

## Arca - KicK iii

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/146002523,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  I like this way more than last year's `KiCk I`, which felt way too ritualisitic. This album strikes the perfect balance between Arca's works for the last couple of years, and more club friendly, more danceable electronic music. Good stuff...

  Release date: 2021-12-01

  [8.7/10]

## Molero - Ficciones Del Trópico

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1427422830_16.jpg)

  Magical synth music. FFO Mort Garson.

  Release date: 2020-06-19

  [8.5/10]

## Steve Hauschildt - Strands

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1321067222_16.jpg)

  Minimalist electronic ambient music. The perfect music to wake up to.

  Release date: 2016-10-28

  [8.3/10]

## Princess Diana of Wales - Princess Diana of Wales

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/778315/large/4251804130820_2500-2.jpg)

  Sad ghosts playing dream pop music, or something.

  Release date: 2021-11-29

  [8.3/10]

## Lyra Pramuk - Delta

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1839035626_16.jpg)

  A compilation of remixed versions of the songs from 2020's `Fountain`, and some collaborative materials between Pramuk and artists such as Kara-Lis Coverdale and KMRU. I really like the `Tendril` rework from Hudson Mohawke...

  Release date: 2021-09-17

  [8.2/10]

## Killie - 犯罪者が犯した罪の再審始まる

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/97200876,1v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Legendary Japanese screamo band finally issued their first proper full length album. This one feels more cohesive than their previous stuff. It's got a lot of melodic punk influence, but not to the point where it becomes too iritating to listen to.

  Release date: 2021-01-01

  [8.1/10]

## Meitei - Kofu II

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0612322967_16.jpg)

  Is he listening to more funk records nowadays?

  Release date: 2021-12-10

  [8.1/10]

## Plebeian Grandstand - Rien ne suffit

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0241042140_16.jpg)

  Avant-garde black metal. Sounds real nasty.

  Release date: 2021-11-19

  [8.1/10]

## Celestial - I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0428433111_16.jpg)

  Soothing guitar ambient music. Kind of like Roy Montgomery, but less reliant on reverb and more emphasis on lo-fi aesthetics.

  Release date: 2021-08-05

  [7.9/10]

## Arca - KICK ii

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/145907733,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  This feels like it's the link between `KicK iii` and `KiCk I`. I like the track `Confianza` a lot but the others feel a bit tame (compared with `KicK iii`.)

  Release date: 2021-11-30

  [7.8/10]

## Sega Bodega - Romeo

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0790768225_16.jpg)

  Not as bombastic as his previous record, but still pretty dope.

  Release date: 2021-11-12

  [7.7/10]

## This Mortal Coil - It'll End In Tears

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/tw/413912,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Monumental dream pop album. To me the vocals feel too grandiose, but then I should probably give this a bit more spins to fully understand why people love this album so much...

  Release date: 1984-10-01

  [7.6/10]

## Klein - Harmattan

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2844532200_16.jpg)

  Modern composition. I don't think I fully understand this music... it is indeed very eerie though. Something that should definitely be revisited.

  Release date: 2021-11-19

  [7.6/10]

## GAS - Der Lange Marsch

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3367308465_16.jpg)

  This is more in line with `Rausch` than `Pop`, though some snippets of the latter can be found in this album quite easily. I guess it kind of makes sense, with the rumor that this is the final album under the GAS moniker... The steady bass drum makes this album feel unnerving, even with the synths doing major chord pads.

  Release date: 2021-12-03

  [7.6/10]

## Rival Consoles - Overflow

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0190906826_16.jpg)

  Dub techno / IDM. It is not bad but also not all that interesting, and the philosophy references don't really help...

  Release date: 2021-09-24

  [7.3/10]

## Fluxion - Parallel Moves

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1654347739_16.jpg)

  OK dub techno.

  Release date: 2021-10-15

  [7.2/10]

## Vacant Position - Luna

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1422727972_16.jpg)

  Saw this nice little screamo release on Reddit. Straight up screamo stuff, sounds pretty tight but too short.

  Release date: 2021-11-20

  [7.2/10]

## END - Splinters from an Ever-Changing Face

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0538522401_16.jpg)

  Nails-esque metalcore. But not as good as Nails...

  Release date: 2020-06-05

  [6.9/10]
