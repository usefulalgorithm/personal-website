  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0118737312_10.jpg)

  Holy balls

  Release date: 2020-04-24

  [9.5/10]

### Yaeji - What We Drew

  ![](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2020/yaeji_what-we-drew_mixtape.jpg)

  Awesome bedroom electro-pop.

  Release date: 2020-04-02

  [8.7/10]

### Farwarmth - Momentary Glow

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3220871233_10.jpg)

  FFO Ben Frost.

  Release date: 

  [8.6/10]

### Shabazz Palaces - The Don Of Diamond Dreams

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0977926780_10.jpg)

  Honestly while I do think they're definitely one of the best in the experimental hip-hop game I couldn't really finish any of their earlier albums. This one I can finish, and I dig it... The beats are playful and the instrumentation is lush, don't really think there's anything to pick on this album. Good stuff.

  Release date: 2020-04-17

  [8.6/10]

### Laura Marling - Song For Our Daughter

  ![](https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2020/04/laura-marling-song-for-our-daughter-1586186134.jpg)

  Excellent folk record. Don't think there's anybody that would not like this album.

  Release date: 2020-04-10

  [8.5/10]

### Evan Caminiti - Varispeed Hydra

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1729379420_10.jpg)

  Deep ambient dub.

  Release date: 2020-04-03

  [8.5/10]

### Iceblink - Carpet Cocoon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3085061054_10.jpg)

  Indietronica / folktronica / bedroom music. It's got that intimacy in last year's Ernest Hood record, but with more instrumentation and more jazz influence. I really dig it.

  Release date: 2020-01-24

  [8.4/10]

### Midwife - Forever

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1938563710_16.jpg)

  Slowcore / indie pop.

  Release date: 2021-05-31

  [8.3/10]

### DJ Trystero - High Speed Wind

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4129561306_10.jpg)

  Lo-fi dub techno.

  Release date: 2020-03-13

  [8.3/10]

### Mamaleek - Come & See

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0687484033_10.jpg)

  FFO Botanist. Though I like the first two songs the most, every track on this album is very enjoyable experimental black metal song. I like how the guitars are drenched in reverb and instead of being ultra high gain they have a somewhat twang-ish quality.

  Release date: 2019-12-06

  [8.3/10]

### Felicia Atkinson - Everything Evaporate

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3701844598_10.jpg)

  Droning, hypnagogic ambient. I think this is one of those albums that the listener would have to concentrate on listening in order to fully appreciate the intricacies of the entire thing.

  Release date: 2020-04-03

  [8.3/10]

### Yves Tumor - Heaven To A Tortured Mind

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0934507009_10.jpg)

  I was under the impression that Yves Tumor produces music that are too hard to actually enjoy, although dude's last album Safe In The Hands Of Love is actually pretty chill. This one carries over the atmospheric experimental R&B vibe from the said album, but the production is more minimalistic and stripped down, and the overall sound is more reminiscent of the old school R&B.

  Release date: 2020-04-03

  [8.3/10]

### downy - 第七作品集『無題』

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/70008969,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Basically what you'd expect from them. Awesome futuristic post-rock.

  Release date: 2020-03-18

  [8.2/10]

### DJ Python - Mas Amable

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1285541562_10.jpg)

  Dub techno / ambient. Super hypnotic stuff.

  Release date: 2020-04-10

  [8.2/10]

### Waclaw Zimpel - Massive Oscillations

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4063250716_10.jpg)

  Psyched out jazz + minimal electronica? Mesmerizing stuff.

  Release date: 2020-01-31

  [8.2/10]

### Lyra Pramuk - Fountain

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2386861821_10.jpg)

  Experimental choir music? Everything on this record seems to be consisted of her voice only. The artist collaborated with Holly Herndon and Colin Self, so that kind of gives away what to expect on this album.

  Release date: 2017-08-18

  [8.2/10]

### D.K. - The Goddess Is Dancing

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4114687325_10.jpg)

  Ambient house with elements from Vietnamese ritual music.

  Release date: 2020-03-13

  [8.1/10]

### Rina Sawayama - Sawayama

  ![](https://i2.wp.com/fulfillthedreams.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rina-sawayama.jpg?fit=600%2C600&ssl=1)

  In contrast to her debut mini album, which has a super prevalent vaporwave plus 90's J-pop vibe, this one feels more grandiose, less nostalgic, and more in the context of contemporary pop music. The nu metal references are pretty evident, though personally I'm way into J-pop / R&B than nu metal I wouldn't say the element's appearance is out of place or bizarre. Take the track STFU! for example, when it came out as a single I was a bit taken aback but in the context of the entire album it feels way more natural and refreshing. Cue Poppy who actually came out with a djent-pop record earlier this year and totally butchered it...

  Release date: 2020-04-17

  Anyhow I think aesthetically I prefer Rina to this project but there are tracks that I enjoy quite a bit, like Bad Friend, Comme Des Garcons (Like The Boys) and Akasaka Sad.

  [8.0/10]

### Laurel Halo - Possessed

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4097218049_10.jpg)

  This one is another step from the older hypnagogic pop / techno stuff. I think overall while this album is indeed experimental and bold its predecessor Raw Silk Uncut Wood is much more approachable and sonially more appealing. Fav song on this album would be Hyphae, pretty unsettling track.

  Release date: 2021-04-16

  [7.9/10]

### Electric Indigo - Ferrum

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2172751518_10.jpg)

  Pulsating ambient techno. I feel like there really isn't a lot of higher pitches or tones in this album, and it's full on percussion and wobbly beats.

  Release date: 2021-01-15

  [7.9/10]

### Arca - @@@@@

  ![](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2020/arca-at.jpg)

  On Spotify this album is a sinlge 62 minute track so it's difficult to really pinpoint the songs or bits I like most. The one at around 40 minutes mark is pretty memorable and definitely the one that leaves the most impression to me but the album in its entirety is pretty enjoyable. Stylistically this one is a continuation from her previous album Arca, but less baroque (well at least that how I felt when listening to that album) and more approachable.

  Release date: 2020-02-21

  [7.8/10]

### Nathan Fake - Blizzards

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2597194388_10.jpg)

  Vibrant IDM.

  Release date: 2020-09-18

  [7.8/10]

### Thundercat - It Is What It Is

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3223710997_10.jpg)

  Didn't really check out Drunk, maybe I should... this one doesn't stray off from his comfort zone too much. The bass and all the other instruments are very stellar, the mix could be done a bit better though in my opinion.

  Release date: 2020-04-03

  [7.7/10]

### Higher Intelligence Agency - Preform

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2740145258_10.jpg)

  Dub techno / IDM.

  Release date: 2020-04-03

  [7.6/10]

### Daniel Avery, Alessandro Cortini - Illusion Of Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2731564252_10.jpg)

  I appreciate how this album showcases both artists' artistic tendencies. Instead of sounding like Avery's own rave-worthy dub techno this one features a fair share of Cortini's almost post-rockish ambient textures. To be frank I prefer Song For Alpha more than this album, but this one isn't a bad album by any means.

  Release date: 2020-03-27

  [7.6/10]

### Old Man Gloom - Seminar IX: Darkness Of Being

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0687781846_10.jpg)

  Pretty gnarlly post-metal. The first track was really crushing but there are other songs that are borderline cheesy stoner metal like In Your Name, and I don't really love those tracks.

  Release date: 2020-03-23

  [7.5/10]

### Gil Scott-Heron, Makaya McCraven - We’re New Again: A Reimagining by Makaya McCraven

  ![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed411242a8099b679a72637c3ced179d9b228c89/0_11_1000_989/master/1000.jpg?width=1920&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4e3b49a9a25888439ff6c4a934398771)

  Nu jazz / blues.

  Release date: 

  [7.4/10]

### Witch Prophet - DNA Activation

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3494376495_10.jpg)

  Eastern Africa jazz + R&B. Pretty easy to follow along, but a bit too much on the safe side.

  Release date: 2011-12-30

  [7.3/10]

### Menzi - Impazamo

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0595211791_10.jpg)

  So there's this new music genre called Gqom in South Africa, and Menzi is one of the scene's leading artists. This album can be best described as dark tribal experimental dance music, haven't listened to any other stuff labeled as Gqom nor done any sort of looking up on more infos about the scene... I guess if you dig Tzusing then this might be your stuff?

  Release date: 2020-03-27

  [7.3/10]

### Dean Blunt - Roaches 2012-2019

  ![](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2020/dean-blunt-roaches.jpg)

  Left field experimental pop compilation. Has a bunch of radio indie rock samples but the vocals are purposely super off-key and weird...

  Release date: 2020-03-25

  [7.2/10]

### Knxwledge - 1988

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2337467203_10.jpg)

  Basically a collection of cut up hip-hop / R&B samples. Some tracks are pretty decent but they don't last long. Think Madvillainy vol. 3 but weaker and less fun.

  Release date: 2020-03-27

  [7.2/10]

### Ohyung - Protector

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1895134906_10.jpg)

  Aggressive experimental trap. The more noise oriented tracks are my jam, but the track Shenme Gui, I'm like... 什麼鬼？

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [6.8/10]

### P22 - Human Snake

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1088025982_10.jpg)

  There's a ton of Sonic Youth vibes in this EP. Not bad but not really what people would describe as highly original...

  Release date: 2020-04-03

  [6.7/10]

### Nghtcrwlr - Let The Children Scream

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2278590743_10.jpg)

  Experimental goth trap / lo-fi noise pop. 有點中二...

  Release date: 2020-02-21

  [6.5/10]

### The Strokes - The New Abnormal

  ![](https://fordhamobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nyckole-Lopez-ram-jams.jpeg)

  I mean it's not a bad album but I just don't like post-punk revival as a whole, and the fact that the chords are pretty predictable does not help. I know this one's been getting rave reviews but I'm like, meh...

  Release date: 2020-04-10

  Also there's way too much unnecessary falsettos in this album. Not for me.

  [6.3/10]

### Fiona Apple - Fetch The Bolt Cutters

  ![](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4372ae558d5cbc5dac55a07b147b42ab34b94d83/0_0_2200_2200/master/2200.jpg?width=1920&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e4f529883137d437345e219288a938d7)

  我真的是覺得還好......

  Release date: 2020-04-17

  [6.0/10]

### Suhjan Stevens, Lowell Brams - Aporia

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4097984798_10.jpg)

  Ambient / new-age electronica. To me the album is overall pretty underdeveloped and feels like a soundtrack to some 80's sci-fi movie. There are moments reminiscent of other big name ambient musicians, but the songs are just too short to leave any meaningful impression to me. If one wants to try Sufjan's music it's probably a good idea to start with another one...

  Release date: 2020-03-24

  [6.0/10]

### Jon Hassell - Vernal Equinox

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3647274627_10.jpg)

  According to Spotify my go-to musical genre is Fourth World. Not sure why...

  Release date: 1978

  [8.7/10]

### American Grandma - Superdog

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0428839596_10.jpg)

  Found this in The Flenser's Facebook group. Slowcore.

  Release date: 2014-09-29

  [8.6/10]

### Move D, Benjamin Brunn - Let's Call It A Day

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1231250279_10.jpg)

  Deep house / ambient / minimal techno.

  Release date: 2020-02-14

  [8.4/10]

### Cremation Lily - The Processes And Instruments Of Normal People

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0383221734_10.jpg)

  Lofi ambient techno.

  Release date: 2017-09-07

  [8.3/10]

### Yazz Ahmed - Polyhymnia

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2273370542_10.jpg)

  Outstanding world jazz. No idea why Spotify put this in the recommended for section at Richard Dawson's page though.

  Release date: 2014

  [8.2/10]

### John Roberts - Can Thought Exist Without The Body

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1480127512_10.jpg)

  Classical influenced ambient music. Almost passed out with this on repeat while I was in the tub, damn...

  Release date: 2019-10-18

  [8.0/10]

### 100 Gecs - 1000 Gecs

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2604863078_10.jpg)

  I don't get it...

  Release date: 2019-05-31

  [5.0/10]
