## Still House Plants - If I Don't Make It, I Love U

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3585616563_16.jpg)

  Warbly jazzy post-rock with R&B vocals. Sick album. Every track is worth recommending.

  Release date: 2024-04-12

  [8.9/10]

## Dip Friso - Dip Friso

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3546631443_16.jpg)

  Drunk bedroom indietronica. Hazy lo-fi music, I like this a lot.

  Release date: 2024-03-01

  [8.4/10]

## samlrc - A Lonely Sinner

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2267912061_16.jpg)

  Lo-fi post-rock / shoegaze. FFO Weatherday. One dude on RYM said it's deathconsciousness for furries and I kinda agree.

  Release date: 2024-03-08

  [8.4/10]

## Lanark Artefax - Metallur

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0269015519_16.jpg)

  Hits just as hard as the last one.

  Release date: 2024-03-20

  [8.4/10]

## Not Waving, Romance - Infinite Light

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1593245468_16.jpg)

  This is just as good as the last one. Ambient bliss.

  Release date: 2024-05-03

  [8.4/10]

## claire rousay - sentiment

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3462825685_16.jpg)

  Low + Organ Tapes. I love her earlier, much more experimental work, but I also love emo and slowcore.

  Release date: 2024-04-19

  [8.3/10]

## Ulla, Ultrafrog - It Means A Lot

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3706881805_16.jpg)

  Abstract shoegazy ambient.

  Release date: 2024-04-12

  [8.2/10]

## Adrianne Lenker - Bright Future

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2431419636_16.jpg)

  Indie folk. Normally I'm not too excited about this kind of music but this is pretty awesome.

  Release date: 2024-03-22

  [8.2/10]

## Serengeti - KDIV

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1855983942_16.jpg)

  Jazz-hop. Gotta follow the Kenny Dennis story arc... Also sick beats by Kenny Segal. Sulfjan Stevens is on this one as well?

  Release date: 2024-04-05

  [8.2/10]

## Sega Bodega - Dennis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4199457831_16.jpg)

  Intimate, dark-club-friendly electro-pop. I really like the lead singles `Deer Teeth` and `Kepko`, in fact I think these two are the tracks that really stand out in the end - the other tracks are also pretty good but I don't think they're as thoroughly developed as the two lead singles.

  Release date: 2017-06-16

  [8.0/10]

## Bongripper - Empty

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3684188477_16.jpg)

  The heaviest band on earth is back.

  Release date: 1969-06-06

  [7.8/10]

## Leon Vynehall - Music for the Uninvited

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1315260092_16.jpg)

  Deep house. I like his stuff on DJ Kicks. I think people who like St Germain's `Tourist` would dig this.

  Release date: 2014-03-24

  [7.9/10]

# R.J.F.- Strange Going

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0681827151_16.jpg)

  Dark minimalist indie pop. Album cover looks like dude having time of his life but songs are gothic and dark AF.

  [7.7/10]

## Andrew Pekler, SG - Rain Revisited

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3276674456_16.jpg)

  Ambient / modern classical. Quite lovely.

  Release date: 2024-04-12

  [7.6/10]

## Oldboy, Sekwence - Good Guys Don't Wear White

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0540330936_16.jpg)

  I like the beats but Sekwence's raspy voice doesn't really do it for me.

  Release date: 1966-01-01

  [7.3/10]

## Ὁπλίτης - Παραμαινομένη

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2797313678_10.jpg)

  Prog black metal. This one feels more forced than their previous albums. It features a lot more sax, folk guitars and even a little bit of Dream Theater-ish synth solos but they all sound kind of out of place.

  Release date: 2024-01-12

  [6.3/10]

## Knocked Loose - You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3381223303_16.jpg)

  I don't get the hype around this album. To me it's very annoying to listen to, those downtuned guitars and open chords and breakdowns just are no longer my thing.

  Release date: 2024-05-10

  [5.5/10]
