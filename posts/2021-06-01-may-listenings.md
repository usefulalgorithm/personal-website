## 2021 Releases

### Perc - Bitter Music

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0083396422_10.jpg)

  Industrial techno. Makes you want to party really hard even if you're trapped in the apartment.

  [8.6/10]

### Cities Aviv - The Crashing Sound of How It Goes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2628284613_16.jpg)

  Although it's probably most fitting to be called an experimental hip-hop album, the songs are actually very easy to approach. Kind of feels like Madvillainy meets vaporwave, and then the whole thing is fed into a lofi chorus pedal.

  [8.5/10]

### Various Artists - Arc Mountain

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0546538577_10.jpg)

  A compilation from artists from Deathbomb Arc and Hausu Mountain, two of my favorite labels right now. Fire-toolz is an underrated producer...
  
  [8.4/10]

### Maxwell Sterling - Turn Of Phrase

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3828781441_10.jpg)

  Crystalline electronic ambient.

  [8.4/10]

### Matt Sweeney, Bonnie Prince Billy - Superwolves

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0108661361_16.jpg)

  Country. BPB is still on top of the game, love this one.

  [8.3/10]

### Lost Girls - Menneskekollektivet

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4284969468_16.jpg)

  Jenny Hval does dance music. It's actually pretty cool.

  [8.3/10]

### Minotaur Shock - Qi

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0194644400_16.jpg)

  Crystalline techno music. Kind of reminds me of Chekov's EP from last year. Very enjoyable.

  [8.3/10]

### Brockhampton - Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine
  
  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1442007424_16.jpg)
  
  This is actually the first Brockhampton album for me... The first 2 tracks are pretty dope. Overall this one feels a lot like something that we hear all the time at around 2000.

  [8.3/10]

### Yukika - Timeabout,

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/112778807,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Another stellar future pop EP from an artist on top of the K-pop game (not that I'm too indulgent on the genre though). Although one can argue there really isn't a whole lot of new ideas on this album, the songs on this album is undeniably catchy and enjoyable.

  [8.1/10]

### Mark Fell, Will Guthrie - Infoldings / Diffractions

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/707609/large/cover.jpg)

  If there ever is a club that plays "Infoldings" on repeat and no drink spilt on the floor and people go there to read books instead of talking about nothing until getting completely wasted, I'd go there regularly.

  [8.1/10]

### Leon Vynehall - Rare, Forever

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2269452384_16.jpg)

  Highly enjoyable, slithering club music. I like the first several tracks like "Ecce! Ego" and "Mothra" a lot, but the latter tracks don't really stand out that much.

  [7.8/10]

### Vatican Shadows - SR71 Blackbird Survivors

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3503910663_16.jpg)
  
  Bleak, elusive industrial ritual music.

  [7.8/10]

### Masayoshi Fujita - Bird Ambience

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1668984311_10.jpg)

  On this record he plays marimba instead of vibraphone, and has more accompanying instruments and textures. That being said, I prefer the pure, sorrowful Apologue to this one though.

  [7.7/10]

## Lucinda Chua - Antidotes 2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2842462965_16.jpg)

  Too short... 4 really soothing songs.

  [7.7/10]

### Sons Of Kemet - Black To The Future

  ![](https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2021/03/Sons-Of-Kemet-Black-To-The-Future-1617108370-870x870.jpg)

  Compared to their 2018 masterpiece, this one isn't as well composed and overall not as stunning. Still this is a pretty good afro-jazz album.

  [7.6/10]

### KMRU - Logue

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0566108909_16.jpg)

  Newest release from key Kenyan ambient musician features more organic field recording samples and more glittering electronic sounds.

  [7.5/10]

### Caterina Barbieri - Fantas Variations

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0910258159_16.jpg)

  Friends of the artist all do a rework of the first track of her incredible 2019 album, "Ecstatic Computation". I like the tracks from the artists I already love, people like Lyra Pramuk, Bendik Giske, Kali Malone and Kara-Lis Coverdale, but not so much the other techno / breakcore artists. The electric guitar track is pretty dope though.

  [7.4/10]

### U-zhaan, ç’°Roy, Chinza Dopeness - Tanoshimi

  ![](https://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/15/06/GDHV-5.jpg?v=1)

  Japanese left-field hip-hop with new age-esque instrumentals. U-zhaan is a tabla player, so I guess that makes sense. IMO the instrumental is much more interesting than the vocal performance.

  [7.2/10]

### Scuare - Phenomenal

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4251320593_16.jpg)

  Chill-hop. Not bad but not really my jam.
  
  [7.0/10]

### Burial, Blackdown - Shock Power Of Love EP

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2090865224_16.jpg)

  Compared to Burial's other stuff this one is tame.

  [6.8/10]

### Fly Pan Am - Frontera

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0118475710_10.jpg)

  Somehow this feels more post-punk than post-rock. There are still slow, ambient passages on this album, but they don't click that much IMO. The post-punk-y songs all have drony guitar and bass line, which is something I like, but the beats are just too predictable and repetitive.

  [6.7/10]

### Flying Lotus - Yasuke

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1425932528_16.jpg)

  Never imagined FL would create something so bland and so unmemorable... and the anime is a complete flop, can't even finish one episode.

  [6.3/10]

### Telex - This Is Telex

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3581257954_16.jpg)

  More often than not I find Synth-pop music in general not really interesting. This compilation gives me the same feeling...

  [6.1/10]

### th1r3en, Pharoahe Monch - A Magnificent Day For An Exorcism

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3094508516_10.jpg)

  Imagine rap-rock, but the "rock" here refers to the kind of music from Led Zeppelin...

  [6.0/10]

### Gruff Rhys - Seeking New Gods

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0412016282_16.jpg)

  Ew...

  [3.0/10]

## 2020 Releases

### Methods Body - Methods Body

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3719333503_10.jpg)

  Jungle / ambient. I like this a lot, it's wonky and majestic and sometimes jazzy.

  [8.8/10]

### Jay Electronica - A Written Testimony

  ![](https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/A-Written-Testimony-400x400.jpg)

  Jazz-hop. It is very good.

  [8.4/10]

### Oliver Coates - skins n slime

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2959948621_16.jpg)

  Droning contemporary chamber music / ambient. Music for coding.

  [8.2/10]

### Teller Bank$ - The Grotesque & Beautiful

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3363847409_16.jpg)

  Chill-hop. The beat is fluid and the flows are dope.

  [8.1/10]

### Even Less Friends - Starlow

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0823800873_16.jpg)

  Bedroom indie pop. Cry emoji all the way...

  [8.0/10]

### KMRU, Ian Urbina - burmaa

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3207540692_16.jpg)

  I've always had the impression that while KMRU is one of my favorite ambient music acts right now, they're consciously staying away from using more straightforward melodies in their music. This is not the case on this EP though.

  [7.8/10]

### Blessedassistant, Iceberg Theory - The Hierophant

  ![](https://e.snmc.io/i/600/w/d0c55240115560fd011810805a93fdfb/8596717/iceberg-theory-and-blessedassistant-the-hierophant-Cover-Art.jpg)

  Jazz-hop. I like the instrumentals (esp. the saxophone) but the singing voice sounds shaky and kinda off putting to me.

  [7.5/10]

### Rav - I'm On To Me

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4216569109_16.jpg)

  Chill-hop.

  [7.4/10]

## 2017 Releases

### Rafael Anton Irisarri - The Shameless Years

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1391879650_16.jpg)

  FFO Gas, Tim Hecker and GY!BE. Droning ambient music. Also check out his last year's album "Peripeteia", real quality music.

  [8.1/10]

## 2013 Releases

### Bataille Solaire - Documentaires

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4228260437_16.jpg)

  Dunno where this band is from, but this sounds a lot like those Japanese new-age ambient music from the previous century. Good stuff.

  [8.2/10]

## 2012 Releases

### Jessika Kenney, Eyvind Kang - The Face of the Earth

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2194281496_16.jpg)

  I remember listening to Eyvind Kang's stuff a long time ago in highschool, but I don't remember anything about it. This one sounds mystical and has a lot of Eastern influence. Almost ritualistic.

  [7.3/10]
