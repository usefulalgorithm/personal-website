## Charli XCX - brat

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27388e3822cccfb8f2832c70c2e)

  Is this her best album yet?

  Release date: 2024-06-07

  [8.7/10]

## Kevin - Laundry

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0787363036_16.jpg)

  Sadcore / folk. This is precisely my kind of jam.

  Release date: 2024-03-13

  [8.6/10]

## Actress - Statik

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2711438831_16.jpg)

  Hazy ambient techno. To be honest I like this more than last year’s `LXXXVIII`...

  Release date: 2024-06-07

  [8.6/10]

## ZULI - Lambda

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2896138018_10.jpg)

  Extremely subdued post-industrial ambient club. It’s very different from hard-hitting club music he’s been known for. This one has a Coby Sey feature so you know it’s good.

  Release date: 2024-07-05

  [8.5 /10]

## Beth Gibbons - Lives Outgrown

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27316997b4a53ae6b42a4b803be)

  Exquisite folk album. Majestic songwriting.

  Release date: 2024-05-17

  [8.4/10]

## Thou - Umbilical

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3170193588_16.jpg)

  Good. I don’t think they’ve ever slowed down on this one, which makes this one probably their most unrelenting album yet. Earlier albums would have some more mellow moments, this one just makes me wanna punch air the whole time.

  Release date: 2024-05-31

  [8.4/10]

## Iceboy Violet, Nueen - You Said You’d Hold My Hand Through the Fire

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2960899639_16.jpg)

  Minimalistic abstract rap. This is probably the most exquisitely crafted break-up albums I’ve heard in a long time.

  Release date: 2024-06-07

  [8.3/10]

## Fennesz, Jim O'Rourke - It’s Hard for Me to Say I’m Sorry

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4102147259_16.jpg)

  Lingering electronic ambient.

  Release date: 2016-06-24

  [8.2/10]

## Sumac - The Healer

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0387447879_16.jpg)

  Unforgiving experimental sludge metal / post-metal. Four tracks all exceeding 12 minute mark, all heavy AF.

  Release date: 2024-07-19

  [8.2/10]

## Ebi - Space Teddy Collection

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1399381095_16.jpg)

  Acid dub techno from late ambient master Susumu Yokota. Still very danceable, still very dope.

  Release date: 2022-01-03

  [8.2/10]

## Racine - Boue

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3942791908_16.jpg)

  Gritty , glitched out experimental club / post-industrial music. This sounds like stuff my friend would dig. I enjoy it quite a bit, but I think `Amerites`, which came out in 2022, had more memorable moments.

  Release date: 2024-03-24

  [8.1/10]

## L.B. Dub Corp - Saturn to Home

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3303976962_16.jpg)

  Dub house. The first half is more club friendly, drenched-in-reverb melodic dub, and after that the beats get a lot more intense, which is more to my liking.

  Release date: 2024-05-24

  [7.8/10]

## Basic Channel - Quadrant Dub

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273b526841769decb70ffb826ba)

  First side is dub second side is house. I like dub more than house. A landmark release, I can definitely see why this is so influential but at the same time in 2024 there are already things that are more intense / captivating than this.

  Release date: 1994-04-01

  [7.6/10]

## 王若琳 - 破爛酒店

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736f432dd0eac4cce57eebf3f5)

  Eclectic art pop / lo-fi cabaret pop. It’s always awesome to see Taiwanese artists get great reviews, and I think this album deserves it. It’s just I’m past the age when I would enjoy this kind of music.

  Release date: 2024-05-07

  [7.6/10]

## Yaya Bey - Ten Fold

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3007455704_10.jpg)

  Neo soul / r&b. Production is pretty good and the songs are well written, but I’m just never really that into this kind of music, where the groove has to take the time backseat. Live shows are probably really awesome though.

  Release date: 2024-05-10

  [7.5/10]

## Kamasi Washington - Fearless Movement

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0106704052_16.jpg)

  I think everyone on this album showed up but it just doesn’t have that same kind of epicness in his first two albums. This is more like really well produced contemporary jazz music, great players, great songwriting, but not really sound that sticks.

  Release date: 2024-05-03

  [7.5/10]

## Various Artists - Someone Like Me

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0908125153_10.jpg)

  Folk country music compilation. Individually they all sounded alright, but I feel like it’s music that you’d hear when you walk into a thrift shop.

  Release date: 2024-04-26

  [7.3/10]

## Dos Monos - Dos Atmos

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4270796742_65)

  I guess their bars are still tight but the instrumentals just aren’t as far out there as in `Dos City`. `Dos City` was rad.

  Release date: 2024-05-31

  [7.0/10]

## Galcher Lustwerk - Lustwerk III

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2182638904_65)

  Pretty standard dub techno. In other words, pretty meh.

  Release date: 2024-05-31

  [6.0/10]
