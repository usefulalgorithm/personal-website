## Meitei - Kofū

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3633290297_10.jpg)

  Release date: 2020-09-27

  [8.9/10]

## Pyrrhon - Abscess Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1103101609_10.jpg)

  This is some Gortuts level stuff.

  Release date: 2020-06-26

  [8.6/10]

## Asetias - False Peace

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0210308449_10.jpg)

  Thrashy death metal. This bad boy is super vicious.

  Release date: 2020-07-10

  [8.6/10]

## Phew - Vertigo KO

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3753488872_10.jpg)

  Dream-like music. Drone? Glitchy electronic post-punk? A Closer Listen ranked this as one of their top 10 experimental releases of 2020. Though I think they're too heavily into post-rock most of the time they're absolutely right in selecting this album.

  Release date: 2020-09-04

  [8.5/10]

## FUJI||||||||||TA - Iki

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4135375055_10.jpg)

  Slow, soothing pipe organ ambient / field recording. I love this kind of stuff.

  Release date: 2006

  [8.4/10]

## Jessie Ware - What's Your Pleasure?

  ![](https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2020/06/jessie-ware-1593205314.jpeg)

## Loma - Don’t Shy Away

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3976337506_10.jpg)

  [8.3/10]

## The Koreantown Oddity - Little Dominiques Nosebleed

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1484090135_16.jpg)

  Release date: 2020-06-19

  [8.3/10]

## Drew McDowall - Agalma

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3339804330_10.jpg)

  Modern classical / ambient. Drew McDowall assembled an all-star crew for this project - Kali Malone, Caterini Barbieri, all of them artists I'm really looking forward to their future artisitc endeavors. As for this album it is a very mystical album. Like it.

  Release date: 2020-10-30

  [8.3/10]

## MIKE - Weight Of The World

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1764027466_16.jpg)

  Very enjoyable lo-fi hip-hop. Reminds me of Madvillainy for some reason.

  Release date: 2020-06-21

  [8.2/10]

## Black Wing - No Moon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0327304830_10.jpg)

  FFO Have A Nice Life's Deathconciousness. Well it's basically the guy behind HANL so yeah...

  [8.2/10]

## Sturgil Simpson - Cuttin' Grass Vol. 2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1334122426_10.jpg)

  Great bluegrass / country music by one of the genre's most consistent artists.

  Release date: 2020-12-11

  [8.1/10]

## They hate change - 666 Central Ave.

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1792643548_10.jpg)

  Kings of bedroom drum n bass rap are still on their streak.

  Release date: 2020-08-14

  [8.1/10]

## U - Lowlands

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1107200968_10.jpg)

  It's got folk, it's got lo-fi techno, it's got ambient... pretty good stuff.

  Release date: 2017-12-01

  [8.0/10]

## JPEGMAFIA - EP!

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2219405675_10.jpg)

  Pretty good but this feels more like a treaser to something.

  Release date: 2007-06-05

  [7.8/10]

## 萬能青年旅店 - 冀西南林路行

  ![](https://blow.streetvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/132418123_208354917527943_7734680450421899002_o-768x768.jpg)

  Jazz rock / folk rock / prog. This album feels like one single song played in different speed, chords, and interspersed with solos. Or just a really really long song? Either way I find this album less enticing than their first album, but then it is indeed a well-crafted album.

  Release date: 2020-12-22

  Fav tracks: 採石, 泥河 

  [7.8/10]

## Kelly Moran & Prurient - Chain Reaction At Dusk

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0924858981_10.jpg)

  Kelly Moran's stuff on this one is on point, but Prurient's isn't as interesting. Kelly Moran next full-length album when?

  Release date: 2020-12-04

  [7.7/10]

## Riki - Riki

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0220070547_16.jpg)

  Synth pop / retrowave. Pretty old school stuff.

  Release date: 2021-01-31

  [7.6/10]

## Unwed sailor - Look Alive

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3154750242_10.jpg)

  Instrumental post punk? Danceable post rock? Either way the album started out pretty refreshing but gradually lost its shine. Nevertheless it’s a pretty interesting release I’ll say.

  Release date: 2018-02-09

  [7.4/10]

## Inter Arma - Garber Days Revisited

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3768799376_16.jpg)

  Established doom metal band does a cover album. March Of The Pigs is pretty dope.

  Release date: 2020-07-10

  [7.2/10]

## Crippled Black Phoenix - Ellengæst

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0860546796_10.jpg)

  Proggy hard rock / doom rock. I'd say CBP circa I, Vigilante is the best though.

  Release date: 2020-10-09

  [7.0/10]

## Primitive Man - Immersion

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0160033873_10.jpg)

  Though this album is super heavy I feel a lot of the tracks are kind of like slowed down versions of Full Of Hell materials. Gets kind of monotonous after a while IMO.

  Release date: 2010-05-21

  [7.0/10]

## Various Artists - Nick Luscombe Presents Tokyo Dreaming

  ![](https://d1c4rk9le5opln.cloudfront.net/7b342bc1b5e5f95c5bb4c6e32799d88c.jpg)

  Lotsa Japanese music big names are in this compilation, but a lot of them are outdated pop music with soaring lead guitar solos.

  Release date: 2020-07-29

  [6.7/10]

## Ruby Fatale - 彼岸

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/89167859,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  OK IDM, none of the tracks really stands out though IMO.

  Release date: 2020-07-15

  [6.7/10]

## Pinegrove - Marigold

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3643784525_10.jpg)

  DCFC-ish indie rock. Last track is a pretty expansive drone / post rock track but others are just ok.

  Release date: 2020-01-17

  [6.5/10]

## Kid Cudi - Man On The Moon III: The Chosen

  ![](https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/DcghSQivI_KbG6EGmt5R3kQer2E=/1600x1600/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/11163845/kid-cudi-man-moon-iii-chosen-main.jpg)

  Even his best album to date sounds only OK-ish.

  Release date: 2020-12-11

  [6.4/10]

## Pallbearer - Forgotten Days

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3740156325_10.jpg)

  Its all down tuned doom metal in a minor with clean vocals. I’d say it’s definitely on the boring side.

  Release date: 2020-10-23

  [5.5/10]
