## Ulcerate - Cutting the Throat of God

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0552505092_16.jpg)

  AOTY so far.

  Release date: 2024-06-14

  [9.3/10]

## Angel R - Selkie Reflections

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3802053527_16.jpg)

  Dreamy modern classical vocal music. It's like you're in a cave and a spirit is singing to you and you're not scared and they're really, really good at it.

  Release date: 2024-08-09

  [8.6/10]

## JPEGMAFIA - I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4051869210_16.jpg)

  This one is really good, like it stands out even in a discography stacked with hard hitters. The bars are filthy and I feel like he put a lot of effort into making the beats as wicked as possible. Sick.

  Release date: 2024-08-01

  [8.5/10]

## Hakushi Hasegawa - Mahōgakkō

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0529968126_16.jpg)

  At first I thought it’s too chaotic and all over the place, but as I listened to it multiple times it turns out it’s just a really good hyper pop album. Wonky and a lot of fun to listen to.

  Release date: 2024-07-24

  [8.4/10]

## 7038634357 - Neo Seven

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1641023596_16.jpg)

  Warm synth drone / noise. These pulsating notes are so delicate. FFO DJ Lostboi.

  Release date: 2024-04-16

  [8.3/10]

## baby\_\_\_asl - Snakeskin

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3246141178_10.jpg)

  FFO Bianca Scout. Bedroom avant-pop.

  Release date: 2020-05-08

  [8.2/10]

## Blind Girls - An Exit Exists

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1763666334_16.jpg)

  Chaotic screamo with lots of dissonance. Pretty sick stuff, just like the last album.

  Release date: 2024-07-05

  [8.1/10]

## H TO O - Cycle

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1283938153_16.jpg)

  Japanese new age ambient in 2024, still so good. Bubbly sounds. Always been a fan of H. Takahashi.

  Release date: 1997-07-22

  [8.1/10]

## Fontaines D.C. - Romance

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1885243503_16.jpg)

  I was really into Pile, and then I wasn't and I was thinking maybe I just don't like indie rock as much as I did before? And then I heard this and it's so good.

  Release date: 2024-07-12

  [8.1/10]

## Clothing - From Memory

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3310068567_16.jpg)

  Glitchy pop. The songs are very well written, sounds super huge, and L'Rain is a great singer. The tracks featuring Amber Coffman from Dirty Projector really make me think it'd sound much more enticing if they were sung by L'Rain.

  Release date: 2024-07-26

  [7.9/10]

## Denzel Curry - King Of The Mischievous South Vol. 2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1590309662_16.jpg)

  I thought he's gonna continue down the `Melt My Eyez See Your Future`, more modern sounding path, but here he is doing old school southern rap.

  Release date: 2024-07-19

  [7.6/10]

## lang - There is no reply, but sweet wind blew

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1724397817_16.jpg)

  Melodic emotive hardcore from Japan. I think their live show should be really really awesome.

  Release date: 2018-08-27

  [7.6/10]

## Holy Tongue, Shackleton - The Tumbling Psychic Joy of Now

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3035052640_16.jpg)

  Tribal dub. I think their own projects are better than this collaboration.

  Release date: 2024-08-23

  [7.6/10]

## Zeta Io, Ingenue - Zetapop

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1992463347_16.jpg)

  Techno-pop. I like the more abstract tracks more than the Balaeric beat ones, but this is still an interesting project to check out.

  Release date: 2024-08-07

  [7.6/10]

## 渡邊琢磨 - RoOT Original Soundtrack

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e022aecdb113803fd71f3a6e01c)

  Pantha du Prince-esque electronic music and Eiko Ishibashi style modern classical. This sounds quite pleasant, the drama itself kinda sucks.

  Release date: 2023-07-20

  [7.5/10]

## Terry Green - Provisional Living

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2015584547_16.jpg)

  Screamo with a lot of indie rock influence. Pretty raw.

  Release date: 2024-06-03

  [7.4/10]

## FUJI||||||||||TA - MMM

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1714140379_16.jpg)

  Unsettling ambient / drone / experimental music. TBH I enjoy `iki` much more than this one.

  Release date: 2004-11-16

  [7.0/10]

## Wisp - Pandora

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27393b67dcb944df8174fd8356a)

  Shoegaze. Don't really get the hype.

  Release date: 2024-04-05

  [6.5/10]

## toe - Now I See the Light

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3658750944_10.jpg)

  Better than Hear You but still not nearly as good as `For Long Tomorrow` or their first album.

  Release date: 2024-07-10

  [6.0/10]

## Houston We Have a Problem - The Sky Did Not Crack and the Stars Did Not Fall

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273c3d692d5d87bc672915a8a0d)

  Raw, emotional post-rock-ish screamo. Stumbled upon them when trying to find reference for a new band I want to do, this probably isn’t it.

  Release date: 2014

  [5.5/10]
