## ssabæ - azurescens

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1896713498_16.jpg)

  Lo-fi modern classical music. FFO Mort Garson.

  Release date: 2022-10-19

  [8.8/10]

## Romance, Dean Hurley - In Every Dream Home a Heartache

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0935507890_16.jpg)

  So basically they took a bunch of daytime soap opera footages and made them into David Lynch styled synth drone ambient music. The songs are all very good.

  Release date: 2022-09-30

  [8.6/10]

## Maxime Denuc - Nachthorn

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2686757396_16.jpg)

  Dub techno played on organ. This thing is right up my alley...

  Release date: 2022-10-21

  [8.5/10]

## Blut Aus Nord - Disharmonium - Undreamable Abysses

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1144509702_16.jpg)

  Psychedelic black metal. Insane stuff.

  Release date: 2022-05-20

  [8.5/10]

## Mister Water Wet - Top Natural Drum

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3561191462_16.jpg)

  This one feels more jazz than ambient to me. I dig this a lot!

  Release date: 2022-10-28

  [8.4/10]

## Yunzero - Butterfly DNA

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1078917267_16.jpg)

  Dub techno. Dope sounds.

  Release date: 2022-05-06

  [8.3/10]

## Honour - Beg 4 Mercy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3796266867_16.jpg)

  I like Dean Blunt and Cities Aviv so I like this EP.

  Release date: 2022-12-09

  [8.3/10]

## Amaarae - The Angel You Don't Know

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0749697593_16.jpg)

  Afropop / trap pop / alternative R&B. There's no doubt this is a pop album with absolute banger tracks but there's also a ton of dance / afrobeat references.

  Release date: 2020-11-12

  [8.2/10]

## N'Djila Wa Mudujimu - Lady Aicha & Pisko Crane's Original Fulu Miziki of Kinshasa

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1370979743_16.jpg)

  Otherworldly percussive music. This stuff made me headbang at office.

  Release date: 2022-10-21

  [8.1/10]

## Artificial Brain - Artificial Brain

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2049691384_16.jpg)

  Fiery tech death. To me I like it better if it's more on the heavier side (cf. Ulcerate), but this is still quite decent metal music.

  Release date: 2022-06-03

  [8.0/10]

## Fuubutsushi - Birthingbodies

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3375092233_16.jpg)

  Ambient jazz with Patrick Shiroishi playing sax. This feels kind of like Bill Frisell's more soft country tracks for me.

  Release date: 2022-10-17

  [7.8/10]

## Simon Raymonde - Solo Works 96 - 98

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0105019432_16.jpg)

  Dream-pop that is more pop than shimmery shoegaze from Cocteau Twinsmember.

  Release date: 2022-12-09

  [7.8/10]

## Benedek - Zebrano

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2598622269_16.jpg)

  Hi-energy disco / dance.

  Release date: 2022-09-30

  [7.5/10]

## Designers - Designers

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1678632108_16.jpg)

  Delicate modern jazz music.

  Release date: 2019-06-07

  [7.1/10]

## Hildur Guðnadóttir & Sam Slater - Battlefield 2042

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2734af69ca25ca80f83e7765e4d)

  I guess when you're playing FPS games and Pan Sonic is being played in the background it's gonna be pretty good? On its own it kind of feels a little too over the top though.

  Release date: 2021-09-09

  [7.1/10]

## Ela Minus, DJ Python - ♡

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3335859992_16.jpg)

  Balaeric house with dream-pop vocals.

  Release date: 2018-08-15

  [7.0/10]

## Hen Ogledd - Hen Ogledd

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0609021128_16.jpg)

  Noise music with distorted acoustic guitar and harp. It's easy to tell it's Richard Dawson playing the guitar, and there is definitely some good parts but overall this is kind of too all over the place.

  Release date: 2023-01-27

  [6.5/10]

## Caroline Polachek - Welcome To My Island

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0762644395_16.jpg)

  Dance-pop. Not really feeling it...

  Release date: 2022-12-05

  [6.0/10]
