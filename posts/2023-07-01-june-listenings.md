## Romance - Fade Into You

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/870793/large/cover.jpg)

  Nostalgic dreams. Sampled ballads weaved into synths and orchestral music.

  Release date: 2023-04-28

  [8.6/10]

## Mandy, Indiana - I’ve Seen a Way

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2760412963_16.jpg)

  Visceral noise / freak techno. I dig this one a lot.

  Release date: 2023-05-19

  [8.5/10]

## bar italia - Tracey Denim

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0987131267_16.jpg)

  RYM puts this under the category of slacker rock, which I've never heard of before... Post-punk britpop / dream pop.

  Release date: 2023-05-19

  [8.4/10]

## King Gizzard and Lizard Wizard - PetroDragonic Apocalypse

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2805471381_16.jpg)

  Psychedelic thrash metal. This entire album rips, so many great riffs and the drums are crispy and super menacing.

  Release date: 2023-06-16

  [8.4/10]

## Youth Lagoon - Heaven is a Junkyard

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1873613373_16.jpg)

  Indie pop / country. A very simple album.

  Release date: 2023-06-09

  [8.3/10]

## Godflesh - Purge

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0596879219_16.jpg)

  The breakbeat and hip-hop samples are back in this one, and for that I'm really digging this one.

  Release date: 2023-06-09

  [8.1/10]

## Ka - Languish Arts

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273b5843dd42cf02e80fae9e1e4)

  Conscious hip hop. I think this is on par with `Honor Killed the Samurai`.

  Release date: 2022-09-16

  [8.1/10]

## Decisive Pink - Ticket to Fame

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2352823682_16.jpg)

  Electro-pop / new age-y post-punk.

  Release date: 2023-06-09

  [8.0/10]

## Caterina Barbieri - Myuthafoo

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4231551779_16.jpg)

  An album comprised entirely of arpeggiating synth sounds. I like the more melodic tracks like `Math of You` and `Myuthafoo`.

  Release date: 2023-06-16

  [7.7/10]

## DJ Lostboi - Untitled

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3171987100_16.jpg)

  Hypnogogic electronic music. I like how surreal it feels.

  Release date: 2016-03-04

  [7.6/10]

## Amaarae - Fountain Baby

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2737944430c5d0b6eab129b7351)

  While not as rhythmically intensive as her debut album, this album does have more catchy songs, and showcases the vast array of styles she can manage.

  Release date: 2023-06-09

  [7.5/10]

## atameo - it sure is sad to hope for the best while expecting the worst

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1399645903_10.jpg)

  Sadboi screamo. The chugs are pretty good.

  Release date: 2022-02-14

  [7.3/10]

## Khanate - To Be Cruel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3411741448_16.jpg)

  Pretty heavy stuff. Not as gnarly as I'd like though.

  Release date: 2023-05-19

  [7.0/10]

## Geld - Currency // Castration

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1997046881_16.jpg)

  Hardcore punk.

  Release date: 2023-06-09

  [6.8/10]

## Jessie Ware - That! Feels Good!

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0584942997_16.jpg)

  Last album is way better. This is just alright disco.

  Release date: 2023-04-28

  [6.6/10]

## Full of Hell, Primitive Man - Suffocating Hallucination

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0654814283_16.jpg)

  This is probably the sludgiest FoH can get. This album is too melodic, and considering these are the two most dissonant bands out there I can't help but feel it a little out of character. And it's not like those melodic ideas are all that interesting...

  Release date: 2023-03-03

  [6.5/10]

## Dave Lambardo - Rites of Percussion

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1745489369_16.jpg)

  I don't think this shows how great of a drummer he is.

  Release date: 2023-05-05

  [5.7/10]

## Shame - Food for Worms

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3572843218_16.jpg)

  Catchy post-punk, although I really dig the track `different person` I find the majority of the rest of the album to be more miss than hit.

  Release date: 2023-02-24

  [5.7/10]

## Dawn Ray'd - To Know the Light

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2459991396_16.jpg)

  While I think we need more anarchist black metal in the world, music wise this is pretty underwhelming.

  Release date: 2023-03-24

  [5.5/10]

## Clark - sus dog

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3727646661_16.jpg)

  Synth heavy indie electro-pop IDM. This is much less sonically impressive than `Body Riddle`. Quite forgettable.

  Release date: 2023-05-26

  [5.3/10]

## Boris, Uniform - Bright New Disease

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3845512257_16.jpg)

  ???

  Release date: 2023-06-16

  [4.5/10]

## Sigur Rós - Átta

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0854073127_16.jpg)

  Wack. OST for Avatar the movie.

  Release date: 2023-06-16

  [3.0/10]
