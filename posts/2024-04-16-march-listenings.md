## Laurel Halo - Octavia

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1560730526_16.jpg)

  Haunting ambient. Still so so good.

  Release date: 2024-03-01

  [8.7/10]

## Bill Orcutt - Four Guitars Live

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1223027223_16.jpg)

  Blissful contemporary guitar music. This album makes me want to play guitar even more.

  Release date: 2024-03-22

  [8.6/10]

## Tujiko Noriko - From Tokyo to Naiagara

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2514897123_16.jpg)

  Indie electro-pop. This is more Stereolab than ambient music in her more recent works. A lovely album.

  Release date: 2004-06-08

  [8.6/10]

## Dario Zenker - Reflections

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0735408547_16.jpg)

  I'm always gonna front the Zenker brothers. Another stellar dub techno album.

  Release date: 2023-10-05

  [8.3/10]

## Masaka Masaka - Barely Making Much

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2099173198_16.jpg)

  Lo-fi IDM. It's been a while since I last heard IDM that's actually good.

  Release date: 2024-03-22

  [8.2/10]

## Kelly Moran - Moves in the Field

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1031357152_16.jpg)

  Soothing piano music. This sounds more conventional than I thought it would be.

  Release date: 2024-03-29

  [7.7/10]

## Jlin - Akoma

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2431125443_16.jpg)

  Experimental footwork. I feel like whatever Jlin does they all sound kind of similar, it will have unsettling beats and any melodic elements will be used as rhythmic tools instead of providing their own motif.

  Release date: 2024-03-22

  [7.6/10]

## Shygirl - Club Shy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1275812747_16.jpg)

  Clubby dance pop that brings it back to the 00's.

  Release date: 2024-03-01

  [7.3/10]

## Zazen Boys - らんど

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736c815d46f9e1a010649c8fb3)

  This is one of their least chaotic album to date. To be frank I enjoy the noisier stuff more.

  Release date: 2024-01-24

  [7.0/10]

## Frail Body - Artificial Bouquet

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3827186944_16.jpg)

  Loma Prieta sans the chaotic riffs. Only the vocals sounds skramz-y, the other things are more like modern, atmospheric post-hardcore. Quite melodic but no real hard hitters here.

  Release date: 2024-03-29

  [6.8/10]

## Geotic - The Anchorite

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1670281197_16.jpg)

  This is what it would sound like if Roy Montgomery does big chords country ambient.

  Release date: 2024-02-21

  [6.3/10]
