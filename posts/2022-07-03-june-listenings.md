  Every track on this album is a banger. Love this.

  Release date: 2018-08-18

  [8.7/10]

## Whatever the Weather - Whatever the Weather

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2895266978_16.jpg)

  ... I think this is probably my favorite LJ release? It's got ambient, minial techno, drum & bass, and then it sounds like one coherent album instead of a mish mash of things. Really good stuff.

  Release date: 2022-04-08

  [8.7/10]

## DJ Rozwell - None of This is Real

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3061876186_16.jpg)

  Instrumental cloud-rap. FFO cLOUDDEAD... really good stuff.

  Release date: 2020-08-30

  [8.5/10]

## Sofie Birch - Holotropica

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1325560746_16.jpg)

  ... I guess I am really late to the party. Intricate, therapeutic ambient.

  Release date: 2022-05-27

  [8.5/10]

## Quells Chris - Deathfame

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2856747008_16.jpg)

  Took me several listens to fully appreciate it… this is a good one.

  Release date: 2022-05-13

  [8.4/10]

## Luminous Vault - Animate the Emptiness

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0898364167_16.jpg)

  Black metal guitars meet industrial vibes. Like Godflesh playing black metal? Anyways this stuff is right up my alley.

  Release date: 2022-05-20

  [8.3/10]

## Cities Aviv - GUM

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0977381996_10.jpg)

  Hypnagogic rap. Really like his production.

  Release date: 2017-04-21

  [8.3/10]

## Best Available Technology - Fixing Until Broke

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0982272103_16.jpg)

  Ambient… or more precisely lo-do cloud rap tronica. Dope stuff.

  Release date: 2022-04-01

  [8.3/10]

## Boldy James, The Alchemist - Bo Jackson

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273c3fe1ebe8e4d500fae027b37)

  Griselda Records is on a strong streak these days... at first I didn't really pay attention to Boldy's lyrics, but damn these bars are really sick. The Alchemist on the other hand is doing his usual stuff: awesome beats that go flawlessly with the flow. Really good stuff.

  Release date: 2021-08-13

  [8.3/10]

## Mach Hommy - HBO (Haitian Body Odor)

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2735b529e8f3a7b83716cc0c0eb)

  This probably should’ve been his first album I listen to… a concept album centered around Haiti, very nicely executed east coast hip-hop with splendid jazz hop beats.

  Release date: 2016-08-17

  [8.2/10]

## Daniel Rossen - You Belong Here

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273abe77744a2e23b61f60b7426)

  Freak folk / chamber pop. There are a bunch of quirky parts on this album, some even reminding me of earlier Richard Dawson stuff.

  Release date: 2022-04-08

  [8.2/10]

## Ricardo Villalobos, Samuel Rohrer - Microgestures

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3591773298_16.jpg)

  Villalobos' `RE: ECM` felt way too abstract for me when I heard it a while back... this one in contrast is very enjoyable minial techno.

  Release date: 2022-04-08

  [8.1/10]

## Pyramids - A Northern Meadow

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4095720660_16.jpg)

  I knew this was gonna be a banger but somehow I never really listened to this... until I found out one of them is actually a member of TheSounds of Animals Fighting. It's kind of like maudlin of the well, but less experimental and more black metal. It is indeed very intense.

  Release date: 2015-03-17

  [7.8/10]

## E L U C I D - I Told Bessie

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2738953678_16.jpg)

  2022 is indeed a strong year for alternative hip-hop... maybe there'll be a new Armand Hammer release later this year? While his previous albums all felt like they were missing the target, this one is much more cohesive and really feels enjoyable.

  Release date: 2022-06-10

  [7.8/10]

## Priori - Your Own Power

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1345121876_16.jpg)

  Cozy house / dub techno.

  Release date: 2021-11-12

  [7.8/10]

## Luis - 057 (Schwyn)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1656797036_16.jpg)

  Joyous IDM.

  Release date: 2022-06-17

  [7.7/10]

## Rachika Nayar - Our Hands Against the Dusk

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3991433245_16.jpg)

  Compared to `fragments` this is more ambient, more heavy on reverb. I like the arpeggios at the end of the first track `The Trembling of Glass`.

  Release date: 2021-03-05

  [7.6/10]

## S A D - Children of the Sun

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2730cf70a0bfee8b38bed7c7ff8)

  FFO Meitei & new-age ambient.

  Release date: 2021-03-20

  [7.5/10]

## Cremation Lily - Dreams Drenched in Static

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2727382421_16.jpg)

  Industrial noise-pop. Think less refined, less slithery Sega Bodega.

  Release date: 2022-04-15

  [7.4/10]

## Maxo - LIL BIG MAN

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27345ec1089c942ea508c1cc231)

  Downbeat jazz-rap.

  Release date: 2019-03-15

  [7.2/10]

## Mach Hommy - Dollar Menu

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27384b3e81a3eb05d4e56b1848c)

  The first and the last songs are dope, the others only mid-tier.

  Release date: 2022-01-20

  [6.8/10]

## Ghais Guevara - Black Bolshevik

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0922919205_16.jpg)

  Political hip-hop with JPEGMAFIA aspirations. The bars aren't that crazy though.

  Release date: 2021-04-17

  [6.6/10]

## Meshuggah - Immutable

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27321b9c97c81bc9001a807d48f)

  Better than their last one (by a considerable margin), but I guess this kind of music just doesn't get me anymore.

  Release date: 2022-03-31

  [6.3/10]
