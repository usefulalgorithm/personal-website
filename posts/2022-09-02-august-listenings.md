## Marina Herlop - Pripyat

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3601398248_16.jpg)

  Mystical, abstract vocal music / ambient. I like this a lot, and I bt whoever likes Jenny Hval and Lyra Pramuk would too.

  Release date: 2022-05-20

  [8.6/10]

## .glia - Ouanem

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0572052870_16.jpg)

  Bubbly beats... I don't know what it is, it's like Meitei meets Dilla meets Aphex Twin??

  Release date: 2022-06-03

  [8.6/10]

## Maria BC - Hyaline

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2174943959_16.jpg)

  Beautiful slowcore. Really dig this.

  Release date: 2022-05-27

  [8.5/10]

## KMRU, Aho Ssan - Limen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1982655657_16.jpg)

  Another stellar release from KMRU. This one reminds me of Ben Frost's music more than his usual ambient output. Real heavy.

  Release date: 2022-04-29

  [8.3/10]

## Various Artists - Sounds from the Iranian Ultraverse

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1616873959_16.jpg)

  Techno compilation from artists with Iranian heritage. All of those are bangers, good stuff.

  Release date: 2022-03-25

  [8.3/10]

## Shelley Parker - Wisteria

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1562368539_16.jpg)

  Wonky drum & bass / ambient. Always love me some real good, headbangin' DnB.

  Release date: 2022-03-25

  [8.2/10]

## Harvey Sutherland - Boy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3582800648_16.jpg)

  Upbeat disco / funk. Dig this stuff a lot, thoroughly enjoyable.

  Release date: 2022-04-29

  [8.2/10]

## Arpanet - Quantum Tansposition

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4228065150_10.jpg)

  Minimal techno that focuses on quantum physics. This is one of the more left field stuff out there, like it.

  Release date: 2005-08-15

  [8.1/10]

## Hudson Mohawke - Cry Sugar

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3366499892_16.jpg)

  A hyper-pop album that's fun to listen to.

  Release date: 2022-08-12

  [8.1/10]

## Mat Ball - Amplified Guitar

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2202522438_16.jpg)

  solo electric guitar music from guitarist in Big Brave. Minimalistic in composition, rich in timbre and tonality changes. FFO Richard Dawson's guitar work on `Nothing Important`.

  Release date: 2022-07-01

  [8.1/10]

## LEYA - Eyeline

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0186001560_16.jpg)

  Lots of big names on this mixtape... I really enjoy this one, it's just as dream-like as their full length album from 2 years ago.

  Release date: 2020-03-04

  [8.1/10]

## Modern Collapse - Anti-club Music Club

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3296991217_16.jpg)

  Glitchy club-music-inspired techno. I like the heavier, more intense tracks.

  Release date: 2021-01-29

  [7.8/10]

## Janel Leppin - Sister Mirror

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2994591663_16.jpg)

  Modern classical featuring eerie cello and melodic pedal steel. I like how this album is abundant with both unsettling moments and enticing melodies.

  Release date: 2020-05-29

  [7.7/10]

## Cheri Knight - American Rituals

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2576469504_16.jpg)

  Playful experimental music from the 80's. This is somewhat reminiscent of Yasuaki Shimizu's stuff... at least to me.

  Release date: 2022-07-21

  [7.7/10]

## Jamal Moss - Thanks 4 the Tracks U Lost

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/808630/large/cover.jpg)

  Above average club music.

  Release date: 2022-05-06

  [7.7/10]

## Clube Tormanta - O Som Do Labirinto OST

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1607064804_16.jpg)

  Ambient OST for some experimental film. The ambient tracks are pretty spooky, and then there's one oddball heavy metal track. Not really sure why it's there but it's definitely an interesting choice.

  Release date: 2022-07-29

  [7.6/10]

## Moor Mother - Jazz Codes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4226674197_16.jpg)

  Nowadays jazz-hop has become something that whole bunch of artists do but you rarely get really good stuff from. Well I guess it's debatable whether this counts as jazz-hop... nevertheless this is Moor Mother's most (probably) easily approachable album to date. As for me I like the first track, which is probably the track with least jazz influence...

  Release date: 2022-07-01

  [7.6/10]

## Maria w Horn - Kontrapoetic

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1085692103_16.jpg)

  Somber, ceremonial synth music / noise. I don't dislike it but the songs feel a bit all too homogenous to me...

  Release date: 2018-10-19

  [7.4/10]

## Shackleton - The Majestic Yes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1502113690_16.jpg)

  Jungle / dub. I find this to be a bit too repetitive to my likings, maybe it'll grow on me...

  Release date: 2022-07-30

  [7.2/10]

## Kode9 - Escapology

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2726602431_16.jpg)

  Cyber-punk club music. To be honest I've never really been that big of a fan for Kode9, and this one does not change that attitude... To me there are simply too many filler songs in this album, maybe they make sense in the context of being the companion soundtrack to his sonic fiction, but without it they just feel unfocused.

  Release date: 2022-07-15

  [6.9/10]

## Boris - Heavy Rocks

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3795560353_16.jpg)

  When are we gonna get Heavier Rocks? Like, `Amplifier Worship` kind of heavy...

  Release date: 2022-08-12

  [6.1/10]

## Russian Circles - Gnosis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3950455291_16.jpg)

  Probably their most repetitive album to date, and it's not like I hold their last two albums in a high place or anything. Sad to see their creativity dip after the release of `Memorial` still continuing to this day.

  Release date: 2022-08-19

  [5.0/10]
