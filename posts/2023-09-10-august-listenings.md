## Kelela - Raven

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3373717420_16.jpg)

  Alternative R&B / electronica. It's very good.

  Release date: 2023-02-10

  [8.4/10]

## Jockstrap - I Love You Jennifer B

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0869591723_16.jpg)

  Awesome pop album.

  Release date: 2022-09-09

  [8.3/10]

## LA Timpa - Pity by One All Good Measure

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1661194967_16.jpg)

  Surreal dream-pop / trip-hop loops.

  Release date: 2022-09-22

  [8.3/10]

## Krallice - Porous Resonance Abyss

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0071864209_16.jpg)

  It's Krallice doing John Carpenter music. Pretty weird when you think about it... I would say this is more atmospheric than their previous stuff, it's not like the past albums aren't but on this album I get the impression that they're consciously pushing for that. In a sense it is probably their most proggy album? Or maybe it is just the synth...

  Release date: 2023-05-05

  [8.2/10]

## Ὁπλίτης - Τρωθησομένη

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0978358551_16.jpg)

  Chinese prog black / thrash. Sounds killer. Riffs hit hard as hard can be.

  Release date: 2023-04-09

  [8.2/10]

## Dustin Wong - Perpetual Morphosis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3525553174_16.jpg)

  Loopy new-age ambient electronic. FFO Kankyo Ongaku.

  Release date: 2023-08-04

  [8.1/10]

## Headache - The Head Hurts but the Heart Knows the Truth

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3814760352_16.jpg)

  Spoken word / trip-hop. It's not the most complex lyrics ever but it fits quite well with the instrumentals. Vegyn certainly doesn't miss.

  Release date: 2023-05-31

  [8.1/10]

## Jan Jelinek - SEASCAPE polyptych

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0725011226_16.jpg)

  The maestro drops the latter word of minimal techno altogether and focuses on abstract museum music. I can appreciate this one more than the other abstract stuff he did in the past though.

  Release date: 2023-04-28

  [7.8/10]

## Celestial - Listen to the Sky

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0714814814_16.jpg)

  Folky ambient.

  Release date: 2023-03-23

  [7.7/10]

## Jeromes Dream - The Gray in Between

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3699304143_16.jpg)

  On one hand it is great to see a band come back and is doing stuff just as raw and aggressive as before, on the other hand it sounds too much like Loma Prieta, especially the guitar noises.

  Release date: 2023-05-05

  [7.5/10]

## Doon Kanda - Celeste

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3620004111_16.jpg)

  No wonky classically influenced dance floor music, just straight up solo classical piano on this one.

  Release date: 2023-02-27

  [7.4/10]

## Shizuka - Heavenly Persona

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1114088249_16.jpg)

  Ghostly gothic dream-pop. I think I've read people being influenced by it but I never had the chance to listen to this until now.

  Release date: 2023-04-07

  [7.3/10]

## Machine Woman - In the Basement of 83 Men

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0472870516_16.jpg)

  Minimal techno.

  Release date: 2020-11-06

  [6.8/10]

## Larry June, The Alchemist - The Great Escape

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27360bc4a5255b323583cefe763)

  The Alchemist is still great at making beats, but the flow does feel someone monotonic and what he has to say in his lyrics isn’t really interesting to me.

  Release date: 2023-03-31

  [7.3/10]

# Genesis Owusu - Struggler

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273b79995bb1505e8e4f5efae7e)

  I was really into his freshman album, but this one feels more bland and just all crescendo without much buildup or restraint.

  Release date: 2023-08-18

  [6.5/10]

## Blur - The Ballad of Darren

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273fc24d1ba493032a046ffd68a)

  When middle age dudes want to prove their relevance by doing whatever they're doing when they're much younger it's called dad rock. Speaking in terms of music genre this is not dad rock, but aethestically this is exactly that.

  Release date: 2023-07-21

  [5.4/10]

## The Sound of Animals Fighting - Apeshit

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3307726895_16.jpg)

  I still love `The Ocean and the Sun`, but this one is really... underwhelming.

  Release date: 2022-12-08

  [5.0/10]

## Noname - Sundial

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736e2a480f32d1825bbd89fc07)

  Conscious jazz-hop. Musically it sounds pretty good, but honestly including Jay Electronica is just... makes it very difficult to take her lines as something that's been well thought out.

  Release date: 2023-08-11

  [4.6/10]
