## Pavel Milyakov & Bendik Giske - Pavel Milyakov & Bendik Giske

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/729232/large/7072822375010_T70860909550054.jpeg)

  Abrasive jazz ambient. Some time ago I thought Giske was on the path to become a second Colin Stetson, turns out he was even more experimental in terms of timbre and composition. Milyakov is actually Buttechno, and here he adds a deep, absorbing electronic layer underneath the sax that occasionally burst out into the front stage. Truely next level music.

  Release date: 2021-03-26

  [8.9/10]

## Godspeed You! Black Emperor - G_d's Pee AT STATE'S END!

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1526103098_10.jpg)

  OMG

  Release date: 2021-04-02

  [8.8/10]

## Armand Hammer, The Alchemist - Haram

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0731622909_16.jpg)

  Elucid and billy wood are (still) on the top of the game. Downtempo, dark jazz-ish instrumentals from The Alchemist are dope AF as well. Really good stuff.

  Release date: 2021-03-26

  [8.6/10]

## Amulets - Blooming

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0112182832_10.jpg)

  Awesome fuzzy ambient album.

  Release date: 2018-04-10

  [8.6/10]

## Various Artists - La Ola Interior (Spanish Ambient & Acid Exotism: 1983 - 1990)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0240779806_16.jpg)

  I can listen to this all day long.

  Release date: 2021-03-05

  [8.5/10]

## Vladislav Delay - Rakka II

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3232196382_16.jpg)

  I don't get why people don't give Sasu Ripatti enough credit: dude went out on a field trip and recorded some of the most abrasive minimal techno music in recent years, and people are like "nah that's nothing new". Sad times...

  Release date: 2021-04-15

  [8.4/10]

## PDP III - Piled Up On A Couple Of Doves

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2069705276_16.jpg)

  Modern composition / lo-fi ambient. Unnerving, sprawling sounds, gotta love it.

  Release date: 2021-04-09

  [8.3/10]

## Minimal Violence - Phase Two

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1514079938_10.jpg)

  Drum & Bass / EBM. Pulverizing tunes that make you shake your head off.

  Release date: 2020-09-15

  [8.0/10]

## Stereolab - Electrically Possessed [Switched On Volume 4]

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2789169459_16.jpg)

  I enjoy the longer, drone-ier songs a lot.

  Release date: 2021-02-26

  [7.8/10]

## Benny The Butcher, Harry Fraud - The Plugs I Met 2

  ![](https://spectrumculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/benny-the-butcher-plugs-2.jpeg)

  East-coast hip-hop. Pretty good but not something that really leaves an impression. People say The Plugs I Met hits harder than this one though.

  Release date: 2021-03-19

  [7.7/10]

## Feu! Chatterton - Palais d'argile

  ![](http://feuchatterton.fr/media/coverpalaisdargile.jpg)

  Psychedelic chansson... some tracks like `La Mer` and `Libre` are pretty rockin'.

  Release date: 2021-03-12

  [7.5/10]

## Various Artists - Vertige II

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2632155551_16.jpg)

  Contemporary experimental pop music. Some tracks are pretty good but some are just duds to me.

  Release date: 2021-03-19

  [7.4/10]

## Andy Stott - Never The Right Time

  ![](https://imgproxy.ra.co/_/w:484/rt:fill/L2ltYWdlcy9yZXZpZXdzLzIwMjEvYW5keS1zdG90dC1uZXZlci1jb3Zlci5qcGc)

  Downtempo / minimalistic electronic beat music. Wouldn't go as far as saying the dude's "washed up" (like The Quietus did), but this is probably his least interesting / engaging music in recent years. Of course this is by no means saying this album has nothing good going on - tracks like the somber "Dove Stone" and dream-pop-vocal-meets-sampled-beats title track are pretty enjoyable in their own right, but I guess it's not unreasonable to expect more than just a few decent tracks from an artist such as Andy Stott.

  Release date: 2021-04-16

  [7.3/10]

## IU - Lilac

  ![](https://beatsperminute.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iu-lilac.jpg)

  Oddly enough the title track is the track that I like the least... I would still say this is not an album I'd want to revisit (unlike Yukika's album from last year... that one's a doozy), but some tracks are pretty catchy and don't have that obnoxiou bass frequency prevalent in a lot of K-pop productions.

  Release date: 2019-10-08

  [7.0/10]

## Xiu Xiu - OH NO

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1974308725_16.jpg)

  Their most friendly release to date. Honestly not that into this one compared to their other recent stuff.

  Release date: 2021-02-19

  [6.5/10]

## Dinosaur Jr. - Sweep It Into Space

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4116362403_16.jpg)

  idk man, I guess just go listen to Super Napkin instead of this stuff?

  Release date: 2021-04-23

  [5.8/10]

## Wode - Burn In Many Mirrors

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1584589851_16.jpg)

  Old-fashioned death metal. Not a fan.

  Release date: 2021-04-02

  [5.8/10]

## Benny The Butcher - The Plugs I Met

  ![](https://images.genius.com/42d166e02680e89cd762e503316fc637.939x939x1.jpg)

  This is indeed much more memorable than its sequel. Some Wu-Tang level stuff.

  Release date: 2021-03-19

  [8.4/10]

## Zenker Brothers - Cosmic Transmission

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1128404085_16.jpg)

  Wonky drum & bass / techno. Somehow this is very stripped-down and enticing at the same time...

  Release date: 2020-10-15

  [8.2/10]

## Hakushi Hasegawa - Air Ni Ni

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/74251293,1v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Off-kilter jazzy J-pop.

  Release date: 2019-11-13

  [8.2/10]

## Razen - Robot Brujo 

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3718083895_10.jpg)

  Modern improvised electronic music + flute. Minimal yet very dissonant. Kinda like dungeon music...

  Release date: 

  [7.8/10]

## Teresa Winter - What The Night Is For

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/535957/large/RAVE025_distribution-preview.jpg)

  Eerie, sprawling modern composition / electronic. Like the first track.

  Release date: 2018-10-05

  [7.8/10]

## To Rococo Rot - The Amateur View

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0917538881_16.jpg)

  If you know me then you know I'm a sucker for minimal techno...

  Release date: 1999-04-30

  [9.0/10]
