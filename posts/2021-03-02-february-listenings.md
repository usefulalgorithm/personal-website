## Kareem - Zones Of Significant Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0933861285_10.jpg)

  Dark, cold, sprawling hip-hop / electronica. I love this shit. Dissonant yet engaging stuff.

  Release date: 2021-01-07

  [8.5/10]

## Exael - Flowered Knife Shadows

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1858629917_10.jpg)

  Acid techno / breakbeat music made on a half broken laptop. This is something you could put on repeat and every spin will be equally rewarding.

  Release date: 2021-02-05

  [8.4/10]

## Abul Mogard - In Immobile Air

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0873077042_10.jpg)

  One way to tell if some music is good music is to see if it's 40 bpm or less, if so then there's about 90% possibility that it is above average stuff.

  Release date: 2021-01-29

  [8.3/10]

## Tassos Chalkias - Divine Reeds

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1629176144_16.jpg)

## Yu Su - Yellow River Blue

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1249436636_10.jpg)

  Techno / jungle. I don't like the pentatonic sequence in the first song, but the other tracks are pretty dope.

  Release date: 2021-01-22

## Liquid Son - Garden Of Eden

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3695451375_10.jpg)

## Weezer - OK Human

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/103026131,2v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  River Cuomo does Disney songs. Disney songs are never that bad, the problem with them has always been their corniness...

## Raspberry Bulbs - Before The Age Of Mirrors

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4279676239_16.jpg)
