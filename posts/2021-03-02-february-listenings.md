## 2021 Releases

### Kareem - Zones Of Significant Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0933861285_10.jpg)

  Dark, cold, sprawling hip-hop / electronica. I love this shit. Dissonant yet engaging stuff.

  [8.5/10]

### Exael - Flowered Knife Shadows

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1858629917_10.jpg)

  Acid techno / breakbeat music made on a half broken laptop. This is something you could put on repeat and every spin will be equally rewarding.

  [8.4/10]

### Abul Mogard - In Immobile Air

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0873077042_10.jpg)

  One way to tell if some music is good music is to see if it's 40 bpm or less, if so then there's about 90% possibility that it is above average stuff.

  [8.3/10]

### Tassos Chalkias - Divine Reeds

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1629176144_16.jpg)

  Greek psych folk. I like this a lot.

  [8.1/10]

### Yu Su - Yellow River Blue

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1249436636_10.jpg)

  Techno / jungle. I don't like the pentatonic sequence in the first song, but the other tracks are pretty dope.

  [7.8/10]

### Emptiness - Vide

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3179719810_16.jpg)

  Post-post-post-post-post-post-post black metal.

  [7.0/10]

### Atom TM - 0.9

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1144678622_16.jpg)

  Industrial techno. The human voices on this record come off as a little goofy to me...

  [6.8/10]

### Liquid Son - Garden Of Eden

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3695451375_10.jpg)

  Ancient techno that sounds like eurodance to me. Never a fan of that type of music.

  [6.3/10]

### Weezer - OK Human

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/103026131,2v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  River Cuomo does Disney songs. Disney songs are never that bad, the problem with them has always been their corniness...

  [5.8/10]

### 王立 - 我是貓，沒有名字

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/104882883,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  唱法像洪申豪的盧廣仲在 cover 星野源

  [4.4/10]

### Mogwai - As The Love Continues

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1064671397_16.jpg)

  This is wack.

  [4.0/10]

### Various Artists - Sharpen, Moving

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2163956216_10.jpg)

  Jungle / dub / techno compilation from Bristol label Timedance. Wobbly stuff, like this a lot.

  [8.1/10]

### Bonnie Prince Billy - I Made A Place

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3691238933_16.jpg)

  Comforting folk songs.

  [8.0/10]

### Uthullun - Dirges For The Void

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0673459105_16.jpg)

  Pretty nasty black metal, kind of like Emperor + Deathspell Omega and a dose of old school heavy metal stuff.

  [7.9/10]

### Voldy Moyo - Liberty City

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3106289296_10.jpg)

### NikNak - Bashi

  Rhythmic field recordings / sounds of wind blowing.

  [7.5/10]

### Raspberry Bulbs - Before The Age Of Mirrors

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4279676239_16.jpg)

  Raw punk. Think a even more noisy Pissed Jeans. Don't really see anything that's black metal in this record though...

  [7.0/10]

### JPEGMAFIA - EP2!

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1479548042_10.jpg)

  LP! WHEN! 老實說一直出 EP 蠻沒誠意的

  [6.8/10]

## 2019 Releases

### Sam McQueen - Dreams In Sepia

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2291014737_10.jpg)

  IDM / Detroit-styled ambient techno. The ideal soundtracks for Sunday afternoon reads.
