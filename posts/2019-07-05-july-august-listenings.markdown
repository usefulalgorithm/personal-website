This post will be continuously updated. From my comments you can probably tell
which albums I spent more time listening to and which I didn't...

## 2019 Releases

### Coil - Theme From the Gay Man's Guide to Safer Sex

  ![]()

  I alway thought Coil was kinda like Throbbing Gristle, the kind of band that
  does dark industrial music or something similar, but this album is in fact
  very groovy, very enjoyable and not at all challenging. Quality music.

  [8.6/10]

### Dos Monos - Dos City

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1513120241_16.jpg)

  日本什麼時候有這麼ㄏㄧㄠˊ的饒舌團了？飛天爽

  [8.6/10]

### The Dead C - Rare Ravers
  
  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3862347839_10.jpg)

  Sometimes when you grow tired of stuff that is too pronounced, too focused,
  too eager to accomplish something, this is the record to put on. Previously
  I've only listened to their first album and I wasn't really paying attention,
  but this one is exactly what I felt was previously missing in this year's
  releases so far. I guess this can be called a "noise" record? But the guitars
  actually have some melodies going on, and it is not challenging at all to
  finish this album in one go. This is some quality stuff.

  [8.2/10]

### Slauson Malone - A Quiet Farwell, Twenty Sixteen to Twenty Eighteen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3550078679_10.jpg)

  Jazzy hip hop最近應該超多人做，但做得好的人多不多又是另一回事了... 這張很好聽

  [8.2/10]

### Caterina Barbieri - Ecstatic Computation

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3979650195_10.jpg)

  對這種真的是沒啥抵抗力... 好好聽...

  [8/10]

### Billy Woods, Kenny Segal - Hiding Places

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0086800029_10.jpg)

  The beats on this album is very nicely done... I'd say some songs on this
  sounds like a more refined, more nuanced version of the kind of rap music that
  Run the Jewels has been dishing out. Aside from the instruments, one really
  have to take time to listen to what Billy Woods is rapping about to fully
  appreciate this album. 

  [8/10]

### Bendik Giske - Surrender

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0148646964_10.jpg)

  I'd say it's not really unreasonable to argue that any recording put out by a
  solo sax player will be inevitably put into comparison with Colin Stetson's
  music. True that this album features just one instrument, like Colin's many
  recordings do, but the mood presented here is vastly different from Colin's
  usual style. Bendik's playing is subtle yet powerful, there's a song that I
  really enjoy even employs the sound of strokes onto the buttons (I'm not sure
  what the correct words are), and although there are indeed moments where the
  sax is loud and the expressiveness is at its peak, this whole record overall
  carries a consistent, very delicate texture from start to finish. I really
  enjoy this one.

  [8/10]

### Dean Hurley - Anthology Resource Vol. II: Philosophy of Beyond

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0835297698_10.jpg)

  So this guy did the sound designs in Twin Peaks, and is a long time
  collaborator with David Lynch. I guess one can say this is almost the
  quintessential ambient album: all the elements that one should expect in an
  ambient release is here, and nothing is out of place. In this sense perhaps
  one could argue that this album does not provide an atmosphere that is
  different from all the other great ambient albums out there. But still, this
  is a very good ambient record.

  [8/10]

### AMAZONDOTCOM - Mirror River
  
  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1233505055_10.jpg)

  Pretty intense club music. People say it's experimental club music /
  deconstructed club music, but I feel like these adjectives doesn't really do
  anything to describe this record. I like how the songs have an almost tribal
  sound to them.

  [7.9/10]

### Juan Wauters - La Onda de Juan Pablo

  ![]()

  The arrangements in this album are actually much more complex than what I
  perceived when I first listened to it. I think this is definitely an album
  that growns on you. Juan's voice has this captivating quality that makes these
  songs stand out from the average soft, soothing folk music.

  [7.9/10]

### Rejoicer - Heavy Smoke

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0718154544_10.jpg)

  Decent chillwave music from Isreal. In a sense it's kinda like Sunset
  Rollercoaster decided to listen more Stereolab and this would be it. All in
  all not a single song in this record is bad, highly recommended for those who
  dig this type of stuff.

  [7.8/10]

### ANKHLEJOHN - A-Cold-World\*

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0016098400_10.jpg)

  Filthy rap music... I dig it.

  [7.8/10]

### DJ Marcelle / Another Nice Mess - One Place For the First Time

  ![](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2019/jm216_oneplaceforthefirsttime.jpg)

  I like this one because it's got this almost dub-like vibe going on, and I
  dig this kind of stuff very much... Also from her website DJ Marcelle seems
  like a pretty cool lady. My thoughts on this album is kinda similar to how
  I feel about Triad God's album: it's fun and it's got people making various
  sounds (in Triad God it's the dude speaking Cantonese, and here it is a
  dude saying sorry repeatedly or some other dude snoring). I guess the beats
  could've been done in a more stripped down fashion: some songs have these
  little sound bits that remind me of what Foodman likes to do, but instead of
  generating an almost hilariously bizzare (or bizzarously hilarious, both
  apply to Foodman's music IMO) vibe, here their prescence is a bit too
  marginalized and don't really affect the overall sound. Also I feel like
  going towards the end of the album it does feel not as strong as the
  beginning. Nevertheless it's still a doozie and worth checking out.

  [7.6/10]

### Tomoko Sauvage - Musique Hydromantique

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0948776470_10.jpg)

  [7.6/10]

### JK Flesh - In Your Pit E.P

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1877893117_10.jpg)

  太短了

  [7.6/10]

### Floating Points - LesAlpx / Coorabell

  ![](https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2019/06/a1047737656_10-1560868335-640x640.jpg)

  同上

  [7.6/10]

### Mika Vainio, Franck Vigroux - Ignis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0589321348_10.jpg)

  Mika Vainio真的是過世得太早了...
  很喜歡那種很沉的、像電流一樣的聲音，最後一首歌 Feux 很喜歡。

  [7.6/10]

### Paisiel - Paisiel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1009686272_10.jpg)

  很迷幻的樂團，薩克斯風吹得很到位，推

  [7.4/10]

### Chavis Chandler - CHOP SOUND DOJO

  ![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IvA9fh-hL._SS500_.jpg)

  [7.4/10]

### Blockhead - Free Sweatpants

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3456573677_10.jpg)

  我是覺得不錯聽，後面的chill beats都還不錯，但是可能instrumental的會更好吧？Featuring的倒是都不錯，Open
  Mike Eagle、Aesop Rock，都蠻厲害的

  [7.4/10]

### Little Simz - GREY Area

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5c6dc3a7e6b62749928fd7e3/1:1/w_600/LittleSimz_GREYArea.jpg)

  現在再聽就覺得，還不錯，但今年有聽到更好聽的饒舌音樂...

  [7.4/10]

### 海豚刑警 - 豚愛特攻隊

  ![](https://cfstatic.streetvoice.com/music_albums/ir/uk/iruka527/wwJtdbdbuQcimQwuVZqVWB.jpg)

  本島年度indie rock巨作，老實說我覺得聽起來好歡樂... 如果有多一點的fuzz
  、再聲嘶力竭一點，可能我會比較喜歡吧？不過我覺得這張絕對是今年聽過最給力的中文專輯了。

  [7.2/10]

### Blood Orange - Angel's Pulse

  ![](https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/640/azure/dazed-prod/1270/1/1271954.jpg)

  I really think the songs on this album, or rather, the fragments that probably
  could've developed into really good songs, are just way too short. The sound
  is still on par with his previous outputs, but I feel like this mixtape is for
  the ones with particularly short attention span. Maybe this is actually the
  music that represents this generation best?

  [7/10]


### MARKERS - Heaven in the Dark Earth

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3371710779_10.jpg)

  只有吉他的後搖，我感覺很像很久以前聽Hell的某張EP的一首歌，也是只有吉他clean
  tone在那邊彈。雖說不是很特別的作品，但也是蠻好聽的... 

  [7/10]

### Big K.R.I.T. - K.R.I.T. IZ HERE

  ![]()

  If this is your first time listening to Big K.R.I.T. then it's prolly a good
  idea to start with this album. Otherwise this album is basically identical to
  all the albums in his discography. Even the flows are almost the same, the
  triplets and stress and stuff. I wouldn't say this album is not enjoyable
  because overall it's still pretty catchy and pleasing to the ears but it's
  basically just K.R.I.T. repeating himself.

  [7/10]

### Shing02, SPINMASTER A-1 - 246911

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0300069714_10.jpg)

  J-Rap guru Shing02's 2019 offering sounds even more influenced by traditional
  Japanese elements, almost every song on the album is laden with Japanese
  chants or jingles. This is also IMO one of the weaker moments in his entire
  discography. The instrumentals and flow are observably much less playful /
  experimental than his previous efforts, such as 400 or Waikyoku. To be frank,
  I might as well just listen to Tim Hecker...

  [6.8/10]

### Pentadrangle - Voidrun Original Soundtrack

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1015704963_10.jpg)

  Pretty decent chiptune music. It's just that I'm never really a big fan of
  this type of music...

  [6.8/10]

### Buttechno - Minimal Cuts

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1118849427_10.jpg)

  中規中矩吧？電音專輯有更好聽的就是了。

  [6.4/10]
  
### Oozing Wound - High Anxiety

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0319864493_10.jpg)

  樂器部分相當給力... 很爽的龐克 &
  很帶感的sludge，但主唱的唱法我實在是不喜歡。如果是叫Jane Doe時期的Jacob
  Bannon來唱的話應該還蠻適合的
  
  [6.2/10]

### False - Portent
  
  ![]()

  I almost fell asleep...

  [6.1/10]

### Pavel Milyakov - La Maison De La Mort

  ![](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2019/bh057_lamaisondelamort.jpg)

  Songs I like: FFF, Moon Pad。有些歌切得好斷... 不錯的ambient music，整體來說還行？但不聽可能也不會怎麼樣。
  搞這張的就是上面那位Buttechno，可以聽得出來這張的電音感還是有的

  [6/10]

### Pile - Green and Gray

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0120018546_10.jpg)

  Their older stuff, like Dripping and You're Better Than This, are much better
  in terms of song structures and dynamics. In this one I feel that the harder
  hitting parts are kinda rushed together - they're there not because of a
  previous build up or to signify some sort of mood shift, instead they feel
  more like fragments, segments of riffs and do not really sound all that
  coherent. And then the soft parts, while pretty catchy, do not seem to possess
  that grasping feel in the more melodic moments in the albums I just mentioned.
  Pile is a great band, but this album is definitely not their strongest.

  [6/10]

### Kim Petras - Clarity

  ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5983631ff5e231bc4fda24b4/1561002770870-9WYN3T5Q8IQ8RYH2ZGKX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEWEftExrEqI2RLJ8_a08PNZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIGK6sJ7fnfWnpcjO8mkpvc6Yy82nHUnVxx6O7zoeDINQKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/Clarity_Cover.jpg?format=750w)

  不是啊，同樣的音樂類型Rina Sawayama為啥就做得這麼好聽，Kim
  Petra就可以做得這麼水... 其實不算差，但我覺得是也可以不用聽啦...

  [5/10]

### Gus Dapperton - Where Polly People Go to Read

  ![](https://resources.tidal.com/images/1793a27b/13fd/4358/b864/0d4f3703f7c5/1280x1280.jpg)

  The dude's going to play in Taiwan... one thing for sure is that you won't see
  me at the show. I really do not comprehend why people even listen to this
  stuff, to me this record is more like a cut 'n paste of some of the blandest,
  most watered-down moments from several relevant indie genres: dream pop, indie
  rock, synth pop, alternative r&b, the list can go on but I suppose you already
  get the idea. To be fair some bass lines in some tracks are pretty flashy, but
  the dude's voice is just too obnoxious for me to actually remember which songs
  have better instrumentals.  All in all I really don't think very highly of
  this musical project.

  [4.4/10]

### Pelican - Nighttime Stories

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0222825394_10.jpg)

  Not good.

  [3/10]

## Non-2019 Releases

### Tom Carter - Long Time Underground

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1525902077_10.jpg)

  迷幻搖滾吉他大作，相當不錯

  [7.8/10]

### Auspicious Family - Gruff Sequences for Dancefloor

  ![]()

  I like the rhythmic patterns in this record. It's got a controlled texture to
  it and I kinda dig it. One problem I find with this album is the balance of
  the sounds in some of the songs, like the ride cymbal bells on Waxen Folds is
  actually distractingly loud when listened on my earphones. Still this is a
  pretty enjoyable album.

  [7.6/10]

### Sturgill Simpson - Metamodern Sounds in Country Music

  ![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91l88ku-2vL._SL1500_.jpg)

  好聽耶... 而且歌詞其實很猛，整天在嗑藥的鄉村音樂，沒聽過吧！

  [8/10]

### Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe & Ariel Kalma - FRKWYS Vol. 12: We Know Each Other
Somehow

  ![]()

  [8/10]

### Adriana Lopez - Anonymity of Grey

  ![]()

  Very decent techno music. The first songs is very outstanding... I really like
  how the main rhythmic beeps are interwined throughout the song.

  [8.3/10]

### Lupe Fiasco - Testuo & Youth

  ![](https://hiphop-n-more.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lupe-fiasco-tetsuo-youth-masterpiece.jpg)

  Lupe Fiasco有這麼好聽喔...

  [8.6/10]
