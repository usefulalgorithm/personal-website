## 2019 Releases

### 百合花 - 燒金蕉

  ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3790/1*l-qKcyohmV7gMipoRhqYUQ.jpeg)

  I'm really glad there are still decent bands in Taiwan. 不聽可惜

  [9.0/10]

### Telefon Tel Aviv - Dreams Are Not Enough

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2086685438_10.jpg)

  FFO Have A Nice Life and Planning For Burial. All banger no filler.

  [8.8/10]

### Richard Dawson - 2020

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3287790004_10.jpg)

  Doesn't disappoint whatsoever.

  [8.7/10]

### Minor Pieces - The Heavy Steps Of Dreaming

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1496124931_10.jpg)

  Slowcore will never die, but you will. Exquisite lofi glitchy folk / electronica.

  [8.7/10]

### Proc Fiskal - Shleekit Doss

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3307474250_10.jpg)

  I didn't really pay a lot of attention to his last album, but this EP totally slays... awesome UK grime. Also gotta say it's insane how Hyperdub always manages to find dope stuff.

  [8.6/10]

### Loraine James - For You And I

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2645680614_10.jpg)

  Glitchy club music. I like the techno beats on this album. Another stunning release from Hyperdub!

  [8.6/10]

### Maria w Horn - Epistasis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3612208464_10.jpg)

  FFO Ellen Arkbro, Kali Malone and Abul Mogard. I'm a sucker for this type of music...

  [8.6/10]

### Ernest Hood - Neighborhoods

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2835522924_10.jpg)

  So this album was actually released in 1975... I guess Pitchfork is quite accurate in calling it proto-ambient? A large portion of this album consists of field recordings and they really do help bring out an imagination of the American suburbs, and they pair very well with the old time sounding instrumentation. Nice stuff.

  [8.5/10]

### DJ Spinna - 1997 Beat Tape

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0114450960_10.jpg)

  Nujabes fans will definitely dig this.

  [8.5/10]

### Weatherday - Come In

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0151687412_10.jpg)

  This is what would happen if Phil Elverum plays punk rock. The track My Sputnik Sweetheart is especially visceral. Overall an awesome emo album (can't believe there are actually still people that know how to do a proper emo record...)

  [8.4/10]

### HTRK - Venus in Leo

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0618472637_10.jpg)

  Delicate indie electronica / pop. Somehow feels like a sadder Beach House...

  [8.3/10]

### S S S S - Walls, Corridors, Baffles

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4122414895_10.jpg)

  Borderline noise experimental electronica. Think Ben Frost's By the Throat, but more abrasive. I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff...

  [8.3/10]

### Floating Points - Crush

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3345010396_10.jpg)

  This one is more techno than jazzy electronica. Still pretty dope.

  [8.2/10]

### Sana Obruent - End Game

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3077986276_10.jpg)

  Haunting ambient. It gradually gets more intense as the album approaches its end.

  [8.2/10]

### Toshifumi Hinata - Broken Belief

  ![](http://testpressing.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/unnamed-4-768x768.jpg)

  Pretty good new age. This is a compilation of the artist's music from the 80's so I guess it makes sense.

  [8.2/10]

### Danny Brown - uknowhatimsayin¿

  ![](https://d1rgjmn2wmqeif.cloudfront.net/r/b/140897-2.jpg)

  I feel like it's much more surprising if one day Danny Brown puts out a wack album. This album is killer just like his older stuff.

  [8.2/10]

### Cult Of Luna - A Dawn to Fear

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2342486250_10.jpg)

  I don't know what's not to like about this band or this album.

  [8.2/10]

### Sote - Parallel Persia

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3975343313_10.jpg)

  Techno / experimental album from Iran. The plucked ethnic instruments in the songs give a cacophonic yet enticing feel to the overall sound of this album, and the beats are pretty killer.

  [8.1/10]

### Old Man Saxon, Cer Spence - Goldman Sax

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1494436940_10.jpg)

  Quality chillhop. Gorgeous instrumentals and flows.

  [8.1/10]

### Ka Baird - Respires

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2898589848_10.jpg)

  Minimalistic experimental album. Pretty fun to listen to, but requires multiple listens. Greg Fox played the drums for this album.

  [8.0/10]

### Afrodeutsche - Break Before Make

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/600024/large/8718723104838.jpg)

  Funky, upbeat techno music.

  [8.0/10]

### Pessimist, Karim Maas - Pessimist & Karim Maas

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1492866913_10.jpg)

  Chilling, dark and restrained techno.

  [7.9/10]

### Klein - Lifetime

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1340978567_10.jpg)

  That first song was pretty spooky. I like how this album's overall sound has a raw distorted quality to it. Pretty decent experimental album.

  [7.8/10]

### Air Max '97 - Ice Bridge

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0267856238_10.jpg)

  Intense techno tracks here. Put out a full length already...

  [7.8/10]

### Philippe Cam - Rotterdam

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/603138/large/4250472405223.jpg)

  Chilled-out ambient / minimal techno. Some tracks remind me of Visible Cloak's stuff.

  [7.8/10]

### Carl Gari, Abdullah Miniawy - Whities 023 (The Act of Falling from the 8th Floor)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2637908581_10.jpg)

  Pretty neat album. Bass-heavy electronica plus Egyptian chants and trumpets.

  [7.7/10]

### Yosi Horikawa - Spaces

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0610644959_10.jpg)

  IDM + hip hop + world music(?). The songs are pretty fun to listen to.

  [7.7/10]

### Equip - Nocturne Catacombs

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3953437667_10.jpg)

  Funky vaporwave.

  [7.6/10]

### Deathprod - Occulting Disk

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0621828397_10.jpg)

  Industrial / dark ambient. Spooky af.

  [7.4/10]

### Tribe Of Colin - Age of Aquarius

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/611708/large/194491290054.jpg)

  Techno music. A pretty safe one.

  [7.4/10]

### Comit - Remote Viewing

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2918465713_10.jpg)

  Organic sounding techno.

  [7.4/10]

### J Rick - No Retreat No Surrender

  ![](https://www.clashmusic.com/sites/default/files/field/image/unnamed%20%281%29_18.png)

  Short and sweet UK hip-hop / jazzy pop mixtape. I think this mixtape are a bit unfocused at times, but then I like how jazzy it sounds throughout the entire project.

  [7.3/10]

### Topdown Dialectic - Vol. 2

  ![](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2019/peak11-topdown-dialectic.jpg)

  Pretty safe compared to their first album.

  [7.2/10]

### Stavros Gasparatos - Rage Park

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2735971627_10.jpg)

  Gloomy modern classical.

  [7.1/10]

### Mestozi - Peak Communication

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0166495010_10.jpg)

  On the artist's Bandcamp page there are tags like "folk rap", "neo-folk" and "blues", so that's a strong indication of this album being something quite refreshing to listen to. However IMO none of the songs are really that memorable. I'd say this is still pretty much chillwave rap.

  [7.0/10]

### Claro Intelecto - Forgotten Wasteland

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2387742971_10.jpg)

  Dub house / techno. Pretty good and I like how the beats are a bit distorted, but this EP overall doesn't stand out from the rest of the crowd.

  [7.0/10]

### Mark Lanegan - Somebody's Knocking

  ![](https://soundblab.com/images/news/mark-lanegan-band-somebodys-knocking.jpg)

  Alternative rock jams with a gothic undertone. Kinda sounds like the Killers with a raspier vocal if you ask me...

  [7.0/10]

### Bonnie "Prince" Billy, Bryce Dessner, eighth blackbird - When We Are Inhuman

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/593348/large/656605346281_T55408666000054.jpg)

  Not the strongest stuff from Bonnie Prince (Viva Last Blues and I See A Darkness are two albums I'd consider as his magnum opus) . Still a pretty soothing album though.

  [6.9/10]

### Danny Scott Lane - How to Empty a Cup

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0233451470_10.jpg)

  Shimmery ambient.

  [6.8/10]

### Angel Olsen - All Mirrors

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3622966212_10.jpg)

  Indie chamber pop. I feel like this album has a chanson like grandiose quality to it. Not the biggest fan of the flamboyant overall sound of this album...

  [6.7/10]

### Bakongo - Momoweb / Disposition / Goulbap

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2362363052_10.jpg)

  Techno with some African percussions.

  [6.7/10]

### slowthai - Nothing Great About Britain

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0401638712_10.jpg)

  overrated

  [6.5/10]

### Wilco - Ode to Joy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2448959823_10.jpg)

  Don't see how this album is different from all the other Wilco albums. Definitely not an awful album though.

  [6.5/10]

### DIIV - Deceiver

  ![](http://exclaim.ca/images/diiv_deceiver_album_art_2019.png)

  This could be any other shoegaze band's stuff and I wouldn't be able to tell which band came up with it. Or maybe I'm just too old for this...

  [6.1/10]

### Thaiboy Digital - Legendary Member

  ![](https://images.genius.com/749a22e8b967eaff05ef149090199719.1000x1000x1.jpg)

  Maybe it's just me but I've always found mumble rap to be an obnoxious form of music... To be fair some tracks do have decent instrumentals, but then even in the best moments on this album it's just less irritating radio trap bangers.

  [5.8/10]

### Opeth - In Cauda Venenum

  ![](https://i0.wp.com/metalinjection.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Opeth-In-Cauda-Venenum.jpg?fit=700%2C700&ssl=1)

  OMG CAN'T FINISH

  [4.6/10]

### 當代電影大師 - 狀態

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/63748330,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  ... I mean the songs are just really not good... the narcissistic lyrics and the pretentious whiny vocals don't help either. 整個受不鳥

  [4.4/10]

### Kanye West - Jesus Is King

  ![](https://app.hiphopdx.com/app/uploads/2019/10/9bb46e99-8101-4578-9603-6fd014dc8dd0-e1572023071212.jpg)

  I guess Ye made this album just for the lulz. Closed on Sunday, you're my Chick-fill-A? This line says everything about the album.

  [4.0/10]

## Non-2019 Releases

### Fabulous Diamonds - Commercial Music

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1559392827_10.jpg)

  Grossly overlooked experimental album.

  [9.0/10]

### Madteo - Noi No

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/117331/large/original.jpg)

  King Midas Sound + minimal techno.

  [8.5/10]

### Soccer Mommy - Clean

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1223441986_10.jpg)

  FFO Shura and Jay Som. However the album sound very exuberant and lush, and is much more in the vein of indie rock music compared to the said two artists.

  [8.4/10]

### Pan Sonic - Aaltopiri

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/383924/large/0724387436756_T14941618400054.jpg)

  I still like Kesto more...

  [8.1/10]

### Sarn - Postmodern Trash

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1946254583_10.jpg)

  Even if the singing is totally off I still consider this a fun one... just that probably not everyone will enjoy it. The brass in the track Fss is pretty nasty.

  [7.2/10]

### Jóhann Jóhannsson - Virðulegu Forsetar

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/168625/large/virdulegu-forsetar-johann-johannson.jpg)

  Not a fan of the triumphant sounding horns. Overall sounds pretty safe to me.

  [6.6/10]
