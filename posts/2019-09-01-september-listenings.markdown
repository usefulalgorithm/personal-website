## 2019 Releases

### They Hate Change - Juices Run Clear

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0570189926_10.jpg)

  One of the best hip hop acts in 2019 strikes again.

  [9.0/10]

### Kali Malone - The Sacrificial Code

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0547092622_10.jpg)

  I LOVE IT

  [8.9/10]

### Anne Imhof - Faust

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4173800633_10.jpg)

  A soundtrack for an opera piece performed in some year's Venice Biennale. Hopefully one day I'll get to see the piece... this album is phenomenal.

  [8.8/10]

### Tomoyoshi Date, Stijn Hüwels - Hochu-Ekki-Tou

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3708394965_10.jpg)

  Stellar ambient music.

  [8.6/10]

### Ed Balloon - The Dubs

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2796550103_10.jpg)

  At first listen I was pretty indifferent to this one but once I decided to spend some time to actually focus on it I changed my mind. This is easily one of the best pop-rap albums this year. Maybe calling it pop-rap doesn't really do this album justice... the lyrics are pretty dope too.

  [8.6/10]

### Charli XCX - Charli

  ![](https://images.genius.com/40058c4339d76fbfc501bec53d9a26cd.1000x1000x1.jpg)

  I've been lowkey smack talking about how I don't really get why everyone's been so hyped up about Charli XCX, but now I shall repent. Honestly I still like Rina Sawayama more than I like Charli, but I definitely can see why people's been raving about the latter... because I am too.

  [8.5/10]

### H-Fusion - H-Fusion

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/545983/large/0804551303777.jpg)

  Really cool techno... I dig it!

  [8.5/10]

### The Comet Is Coming - Trust In The Lifeforce Of The Deep Mystery

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5c6c54786f31fa3d12a68c6f/1:1/w_600/CometIsComing_TrustInTheLifeforce.jpg)

  Psyched-out nu jazz / jazz fusion. I like this a lot more than I like Kamasi Washington. The sax player also played with Sons of Kemet.

  [8.4/10]

### Ellen Arkbro - CHORDS

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0633098293_10.jpg)

  Not as captivating as her 2017 album, but still a magnificent album.

  [8.2/10]

### Norihito Suda, Stijn Hüwels - Sansui

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1734029736_10.jpg)

  Another nicely done ambient release from Home Normal. Definitely check them out!

  [8.1/10]

### Burial - Claustro / State Forest

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2252348569_10.jpg)

  Half-assed release... c'mon man.

  [8.0/10]

### Solar X - Xrated

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3050085367_10.jpg)

  Russian IDM. The first song is super dope.

  [8.0/10]

### Leo Svirsky - River Without Banks

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1390018712_10.jpg)

  Soothing piano based classical ambient music.

  [7.9/10]

### Mach-Hommy - Wap Konn Jòj!

  ![](https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2019/06/Mach-Hommy-Wap-Konn-Joj-1561389000-640x640.jpeg)

  The production on this album is killer. The instrumentals are very nujabe-esque, and the featured guests are all big names. People say the lyricism is top tier but I haven't got the time to actually figure out what he's rapping about. Maybe some other time...

  [7.8/10]

### Felicia Atkinson - The Flower And The Vessel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3253079313_10.jpg)

  Decent ambient / electronic. Intimate.

  [7.7/10]

### Mister Lies - Mister Lies

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2008434017_10.jpg)

  張揚愛團, chillwave / ambient. The sound becomes more vibrant / cheery towards the end of this album.

  [7.7/10]

### Jane Weaver - Loops In The Secret Society

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1449748852_10.jpg)

  Pretty cool electronic music. Sounds like a less flashy Stereolab.

  [7.7/10]

### SOPHIE - OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES NON-STOP REMIX ALBUM

  ![](https://images.genius.com/46a1fb41b885991354734d2ea01a145d.1000x1000x1.jpg)

  Too long... I like the original album better.

  [7.6/10]

### Octo Octa - Resonant Body

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2005771687_10.jpg)

  Club / house / breakbeat. The music is upbeat and festive, and from the track titles it's quite obvious this is a work that celebrates the queer bodies and inclinations. Not really into this type of  music recently but I definitely can see techno lovers digging this.

  Ecstatic Beat is one helluva track though!

  [7.5/10]

### JPEGMAFIA - All My Heroes Are Cornballs

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0372272145_10.jpg)

  Not really as disappointing as the Tool album (duh), but still... I guess it's disappointing just because his previous stuff are just too outstanding? The instrumentals are much tamer than his previous records, making this album somewhat lacking in energy and edge. The lyrics still slay though.

  [7.4/10]

### Ekin Fil - Heavy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0766026964_10.jpg)

  An even more drowned-in-reverb version of Cocteau Twins.

  [7.4/10]

### Plaid - Polymer

  ![](https://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2019/warplp303-plaid.jpg)

  OK IDM album.

  [7.2/10]

### Iona Fortune - Tao Of I Volume 2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1337714215_10.jpg)

  Ambient with a lot of Chinese influence, with instruments like Guzheng or stuff present. I think the said influence is way too overwhelming sometimes, if it's a bit more subtle and more nuanced maybe I'd like it more.

  [7.2/10]

### Leila Bordreuil - Headflush

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3276332867_10.jpg)

  Visceral ambient music.

  [7.1/10]

### BABii - HiiDE

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3556179400_10.jpg)

  Electro-pop album. Reminds me of earlier Grimes records.

  [7.1/10]

### Kcin - Sleeplessness And Hopelessness I

  ![](https://headphonecommute.com/app/uploads/2019/09/kcin-sleeplessness-and-hopelessness-i-full-res-cover-art-1436x1436.jpg)

  Dark sounding techno.

  [7.0/10]

### Dis Fantasy - Dis Fantasy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2034638259_10.jpg)

  The flows don't really do much to me. Overall a pretty sleek but not really a super-memorable album.

  [7.0/10]

### Kindness - Something Like A War

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1335257435_10.jpg)

  R&B with a twist. Some songs have great instrumentals but the others aren't as captivating.

  [7.0/10]

### DJ Haram - Grace EP

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0205550859_10.jpg)

  Club music with Middle East influences. The song Body Count is pretty fun but the rest IMO are just alright.

  [7.0/10]

### François J. Bonnet & Stephen O'Malley - Cylene

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3711314863_10.jpg)

  Ambient that lacks memorable moments. Seems to be theory-heavy? But I guess it's like seeing installation arts that don't make a lot of sense in appearance and have absurdly abstract names. Of course I'm not saying the artist is obliged to come up with a statement for the artwork, but then is there any point to just shove the songs in people's faces and tell them to figure things out themselves...

  [6.5/10]

### Kedr Livanskiy - Your Need

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1100809650_10.jpg)

  Dub-ish & club-ish techno music.

  [6.2/10]

### Organ Tapes - Hunger In Me Living

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1759705776_10.jpg)

  2SOFT

  [6.0/10]

### IDK - Is He Real?

  ![](https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_limit,dpr_auto,q_90,w_720/fl_lossy,pg_1/gohzl92of5eglu52cade/idk-is-he-real)

  2NAGGIN. No he isn't real.

  [5.5/10]

### Lite - Multiple

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0528657661_10.jpg)

  This one is more lackluster than their previous album. The creative riffs and passages in their earlier stuff is nowhere to be found on this album... :(

  [5.5/10]

## Non-2019 Releases

### w00dy - RNBW

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0273375760_10.jpg)

  Insanely awesome deconstructed pop music. Masterpiece.

  [9.0/10]

### Sugar - No Sex Only Feelings

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3780403567_10.jpg)

  Crazy good techno. Sugar $\gg$ salt.

  [8.9/10]

### Pan-American - For Waiting, For Chasing

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1620538680_10.jpg)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2694597869_10.jpg)

  Lively and vibrant techno EP. I dig it!

  [8.5/10]

### True Neutral Crew - Soft Rules

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1921858756_10.jpg)

  Another new challenger in the experimental hip hop game... this one is more controlled and coherent than a lot of artists out there. I like it.

  [8.4/10]

### Niagara - Apologia

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1277755584_10.jpg)

  Dope electronica. Sounds like some soundtrack to some John Carpenter's movie.

  [8.2/10]

### Elucid - Save Yourself

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1988935017_10.jpg)

  Thoughtful abstract hip hop.

  [8.1/10]

### They Hate Change - Cycles

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0468250147_10.jpg)

  Seriously... They Hate Change has got to be one of the best hip hop acts nowadays.

  [8.1/10]

### Topdown Dialectic - Topdown Dialectic

  ![](https://imagescdn.juno.co.uk/full/CS697951-01A-BIG.jpg)

  [8.0/10]

### P.E.E. - i win me over.

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1973795421_10.jpg)

  Quirky yet absurdly catchy pop punk. Lean and mean!

  [8.0/10]

### Stanislav Tolkachev - Why Are You So Frightened

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0011514446_10.jpg)

  [8.0/10]

### Fauxe - Ikhlas

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0282088231_10.jpg)

  Groovy electronica with a distinct SE Asian flavor to it.

  [7.9/10]

### P. Adrix - Álbum Desconhecido

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3271702577_10.jpg)

  I don't really dig other kuduro albums, but this one sound more modernized and is actually quite pleasing.

  [7.6/10]

### Swarvy - Anti-Anxiety

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0569440674_10.jpg)

  A compilation of short but pretty chill hip hop tracks.

  [7.2/10]

### D.Dan - Covert Operation

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3995439538_10.jpg)

  Club-ish techno.

  Murky ambient / experimental electronic music.
