## 2020 Releases

### Regular Citizen - Patsy Hangdog

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1005281490_10.jpg)

  Minimalistic ambient arp music. Sublime..............

  [9.0/10]

### Joyfultalk - A Seperation Of Being

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1209897880_10.jpg)

  I did not expect Constellation to deliver this kind of electronica stuff whatsoever. Pretty kraut-ish if you ask me.

  [8.7/10]

### Nyx - Aux Pieds De La Nuit

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0476797929_10.jpg)

  Ambient + jazzy drums + vocals drenched in reverb + soundscape. He was the vocalist in Arab Strap, but this album is anything but slowcore. Hazy dream music.

  [8.6/10]

### Fontaines D.C. - A Hero's Death

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3772806156_10.jpg)

  Quality post-punk. Wife digs this.

  [8.5/10]

### Shackleton, Wacław Zimpel - Primal Forms

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2519594284_10.jpg)

  Their Bandcamp page puts it best: shaman music. Shackleton is known for tribal music-influenced meditative jazz / electronic music (not your typical chill-out jazztronica... his stuff is an entirely different kind of beast), and Wacław Zimpel has been one of my favorite musicians for like two years, cf. his stuff on Instant Classic and his Long Weekend EP earlier this year.

  [8.4/10]

### Seamus Blake - Guardians Of The Heart Machine

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3883468019_10.jpg)

  Nu jazz / contemporary hard-bop. I definitely do not consider myself a jazz head, but this is one that even I enjoy and can see myself coming back to it. Harmonious.

  [8.4/10]

### Croatian Amor & Varg2™ - Body Of Lila

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0649250718_10.jpg)

  Bleak industrial techno / ambient album. I like the ambient tracks like Moraine more, but still this is a pretty dope record. FFO Tzusing.

  [8.3/10]

### Yukika - Soul Lady

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/82198336,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  The pinnacle of Korean retro-pop / chillwave. Wonderfully executed. 歌很好聽 MV 卻拍得有點失敗... 希望更多人能聽到他的音樂！雖說某種程度上是在高仿竹內瑪麗亞，但要做到完成度這麼高配器這麼好聽真的不是說想做就可以做到的

  [8.3/10]

### Bibio - Sleep On The Wing

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/659207/large/unnamed.jpg)

  Indietronica / electro-folk. Nostalgic lo-fi sound! Like this a lot.

  [8.3/10]

### Lianne La Havas - Lianne La Havas

  ![](https://www.liannelahavas.com/graphics/LianneAlbumCover.png)

  Pretty awesome neo-soul.

  [8.2/10]

### Patricia - Maxyboy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1840052382_10.jpg)

  Deep minimal techno. Groooooveeeey.

  [8.2/10]

### LEYA - Flood Dream

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0373707075_10.jpg)

  Hypnagogic ambient music. Very sad music... which is good.

  [8.2/10]

### Cucina Povera, ELS - The Oystercatcher

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3486460083_10.jpg)

  Haunting stripped-down electronic music. Very ethereal. If you haven't heard of Cucina Povera yet then you should do so as soon as possible.

  [8.1/10]

### Giuseppe Ielasi - Five Wooden Frames

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1256388007_10.jpg)

  Modern classical composition / ambient. Unnerving, shifting melodies abound. It's pretty mind boggling to me that this entire album was done with an acoustic guitar... what kind of sick person plays the instrument like that?

  [8.1/10]

### Duma - Duma

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3289675772_10.jpg)

  Kenyan experimental electronic grindcore / noise. Insane stuff, it's like Full Of Hell does a collab with Aphex Twin and WaqWaq Kingdom... I mean, what???

  [8.1/10]

### Jun Kamoda - Escape The Night

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3205456153_10.jpg)

  Very funky retro disco house / vaporwave-y city pop. Two songs are not enough though.

  [8.1/10]

### Irreversible Entanglements - Who Sent You?

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0424693587_10.jpg)

  Jazz band fronted by Moor Mother. Stream of consciousness style afro-jazz, super abrasive stuff. 喜歡 Matana Roberts 的話可聽

  [8.1/10]

### Kate NV - Room For The Moon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2857861786_10.jpg)

  Avant-pop from Russia. Lots of synth-pop elements. Dig it.

  [8.1/10]

### Cory Smythe - Accelerate Every Voice

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2865864548_10.jpg)

  Unsettling experimental modern classical, featuring operatic vocal choir, a-capella and atonal piano. Eerie stuff not suited for the faint of heart.

  [8.0/10]

### Jasmine Guffond - Microphone Permission

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2170065173_10.jpg)

  Experimental computer music / electronic. Unsettling.

  [8.0/10]

### Stuck - Change Is Bad

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0562563247_10.jpg)

  Sounds like Pissed Jeans + Pile's first two albums. Who wouldn't like this kind of stuff...

  [7.9/10]

### Various Artists - Join The Future: UK Bleep & Bass 1988-91

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2155654623_10.jpg)

  So this is a compilation of proto-UK Bass music. History lesson: https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/uk-bleep-and-bass-feature

  [7.9/10]

### India Jordan - For You

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0266626104_10.jpg)

  Dance / club. Very retro stuff.

  [7.9/10]

### Elias Stemeseder, Max Andrzejewski - Light / Tied

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3789891425_10.jpg)

  Dissonant improvised modern jazz.

  [7.8/10]

### Trevor - Becoming A Bed

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0120080861_10.jpg)

  Experimental techno / drum & bass.

  [7.8/10]

### Imperial Triumphant - Alphaville

  ![](http://www.imperial-triumphant.com/couch/uploads/image/imperial-triumphant-crop.jpg)

  Avant-gard jazz + black / death metal. This is more playful (albeit in a twisted way) than their previous stuff. TBH I like Vile Luxury more... still I'd recommend this to whoever looking for challenging metal music.

  [7.7/10]

### Rhodri Davies - Telyn Rawn

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1360141894_10.jpg)

  Modern classical with medieval harp. FFO Laura Cannell.

  [7.7/10]

### Ulthar - Providence

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3012301573_16.jpg)

  Unrelenting death metal. Surprisingly melodic.

  [7.6/10]

### Guedra Guedra كدرة كدرة  - Son Of Sun

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3358675395_10.jpg)

  Afro-bass from Morocco. RA says this one has a lot of Bedouin themes, which I'm not really familiar with.

  [7.5/10]

### Realize - Demolition

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2962386076_10.jpg)

  Sounds like Godflesh in A World Lit On Fire but less fun.

  [7.4/10]

### Feu St-Antoine - L'eau Par La Soif

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1736223421_10.jpg)

  Hallucination-inducing ambient / modern classical / hauntology music. Lotsa sci-fi synths.

  [7.4/10]

### Wake - Devouring Ruin

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2083204522_10.jpg)

  Black / death metal. I think there are some metalcore influences going on here...

  [7.3/10]

### Ann Margaret Hogan - Honeysuckle Burials

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3143810304_10.jpg)

  Modern piano classical music.

  [7.3/10]

### The Fall Of Troy - Mukiltearth

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0050301723_10.jpg)

  Some pretty awesome riffs here, but the falsettos still put me off. Also the bass could be louder in the mix IMO. 他真的是很會編那種介於煩跟屌之間的吉他 riff，但他唱歌就真的是有點煩了

  [7.3/10]

### Kelly Lee Owens - Inner Song

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1503838412_10.jpg)

  Ambient pop / electronica. The self-titled album is better IMO.

  [7.2/10]

### Grey Host - The Barrow Path

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2679641587_10.jpg)

  Old school stoner doom.

  [7.2/10]

### Floral - Floral

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2118984224_10.jpg)

  Chon on steroids / Polyphia without being overtly obnoxious. 硬要說的話 Chon > Floral >> Polyphia

  [7.2/10]

### Aversio Humanitatis - Behold The Silent Dwellers

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4015228574_10.jpg)

  Modern black metal. Songs are above average but overall doesn't really bring a lot of new ideas to the table.

  [7.1/10]

### Regis - Hidden In This Is The Light That You Miss

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1768886957_10.jpg)

  Industrial techno. While still pretty hard-hitting this one doesn't feel all that creative.

  [7.1/10]

### Julianna Barwick - Healing Is A Miracle

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1016046330_10.jpg)

  Ambient-pop / ethereal post-rock-y pop. While it is indeed a very calming record it lacks depth when compared with The Magic Place or Nepenthe, two of Barwick's best records in my opinion. If there's a cafe that puts this on repeat it'd be pretty dope though. 之前的比較好

  [7.1/10]

### Oded Tzur - Here Be Dragons

  ![](https://cdn2.jazztimes.com/2020/03/10_OdedTzur-1000x887.jpg)

  Lounge jazz. Very easy listening.

  [7.0/10]

### Greg Fox - Contact

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0193334592_10.jpg)

  His last album was much more interesting than this one. Check out Eli Keszler btw.

  [7.0/10]

### E.M.M.A. - Indigo Dream

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3739234083_10.jpg)

  Cinematic retro-synth music / club. Got a bunch of synth sounds that wouldn't feel out of place if they're in a John Carpenter movie, but the composition on a whole is pretty standard stuff.

  [6.9/10]

### Jockstrap - Wicked City

  ![](https://d1rgjmn2wmqeif.cloudfront.net/r/g/188166-4.jpg)

  Weird pop music. 聽無

  [6.8/10]

### Infant Island - Beneath

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1756856940_10.jpg)

  Screamo / metalcore.

  [6.8/10]

### Behold... The Arctopus - Hapeleptic Overtrove

  ![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0278/0151/8154/products/behold_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1593282927)

  Avant-gard instrumental metal? Anyway this stuff is too much for me... super weird music. Gets a bunch of style points from me for the shreds though. 聽無

  [6.5/10]

### Cut Worms - Unnatural Disaster

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4178474904_10.jpg)

  Soft country + indie rock.

  [6.5/10]

### An Autumn For Crippled Children - Went Quiet

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2067507619_10.jpg)

  Post-black metal. I find it pretty confounding and funny how these black metal bands call themselves "experimental" while all they've done is simply inserting shoegaze-ish major chords into their songs.

  [6.0/10]

### Algiers - There Is No Year

  ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/broadtime_photo/418461810906)

  Gospel + post-punk. This is my first time checking out their music... so they're known for blending soul music vocals with post-punk instrumentations? On this album it almost sounds like the vocalist had zero regard about what his other bandmates were playing - all these crooning vocals just don't resonate with the rest of the band. As for the instrumentations they're pretty bland, nothing really that memorable. Maybe spend more time writing the album next time? 真的是對他們沒愛，但好像也不是說這張沒有新意或是什麼的 - 這是我第一次聽他們的音樂，而是說他唱歌的感覺很煩... 很想在他唱得最投入的時候朝他頭巴下去

  [6.0/10]

### James Dean Bradfield - Even In Exile

  ![](https://cdn.smehost.net/manicstreetpreacherscom-ukprod/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Even_In_Exlile_Album_Cover.jpg)

  Outdated britpop in tribute to Chilean activist. I have the utmost respect for the Manics but man the songwriting on this album is just insufferable...

  [5.5/10]

### Washed Out - Purple Noon

  ![](https://www.magneticmag.com/.image/t_share/MTczNjM4OTEyMTg1NTQyNDIx/washedout-purplenoon-cover-3000x3000.jpg)

  Radio-friendly, empty-on-the-inside indie pop. Or make out music par excellence for year 2020? 美國版 deca joins，一樣是被人叫浪漫音樂但浪漫在哪卻也沒幾個人講得出所以然的樂團

  [4.0/10]

### Ulver - Flowers Of Evil

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2131534361_10.jpg)

  The sad story of Ulver: how a band devolved from black metal overlords to the perfect (or should I say the most miserable) demonstration of how not to make post-punk music. Corny.

  [2.5/10]

### Lamb Of God - Lamb Of God

  ![](https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lamb-of-God-Self-Titled.jpg)

  I mean they can definitely play, but this kind of stuff just no longer appeals to me... couldn't listen to this without nervously cringe smiling. 真的很強！但也真的聽不下去

  [2.0/10]

## Non-2020 Releases

### Space Afrika - Somewhere Decent To Live

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1137618719_10.jpg)

  Dub ambient / minimal house. FFO Jan Jelinek.

  [8.7/10]

### Barney McAll - Mother Of Dreams And Secrets

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3442874330_10.jpg)

  Afro-cuban jazz. Like this a lot.

  [8.2/10]

### Helena Hauff - Discreet Desires

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1656694513_10.jpg)

  Fun yet spooky industrial techno. It's got a bunch of super old synth sounds and 808 beats on it. Pretty cool.

  [8.2/10]

### Maggi Payne - Ahh-Ahh

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3828926910_10.jpg)

  New age / ambient.

  [8.1/10]

### Cuong Vu, Pat Metheny - Cuong Vu Trio Meets Pat Metheny

  ![](https://img.secure.cdn2.wmgecom.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1134/image/1200x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/7/075597946673.jpg)

  From what I remembered Pat Matheny is a smooth jazz guy - listened to some of his stuff in highschool and never really connected. But this one, which Metheny did with his long time collaborator sax player Cuong Vu, is anything but smooth jazz, yet still manages to maintain a sense of melodic progression. 請追蹤 @ginjazzyology

  [8.0/10]

### Quantec - Cauldron Subsidence

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/205650/large/original.jpg)

  Deep dub techno. The last track is pretty dope.

  [7.8/10]

### Akira Rabelais - CXVI

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/565429/large/BKEDIT018_Dist_Preview.jpg)

  Sound design. Museum music.

  [7.7/10]

### Alex G - House Of Sugar

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0886287496_10.jpg)

  I'm super late to the party... indie rock. I suppose this is many people's AOTY for 2019? I'm not really into this one though. I do like the abundant presence of math rock elements on this album, but why wouldn't I just say go grab EEIWALE or Penfold? 這好像很多人推

  [7.5/10]

### Geist & the Sacred Ensemble - Within

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3544643765_10.jpg)

  These guys must've loved Swans a lot. Doom folk reminiscent of To Be Kind.

  [7.5/10]

### Less Art - Strangled Light

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2391621140_10.jpg)

  Thrice + Kowloon Walled City + Curl Up And Die. Sounds like Thrice and La Dispute mashed together. There are some riffs that totally slay, but the vocals could be stronger IMO.

  [7.4/10]

### Roger Robinson - Illclectica

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0463672623_10.jpg)

  Outsider hip-hop / downtempo.

  [7.0/10]

### Botanist - Ecosystem

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2440025988_10.jpg)

  Post-black metal with zither. Still dig their first and second album more.

  [6.8/10]

### White Ward - Love Exchange Failure

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3449550015_10.jpg)

  Post-black metal. The second song even features a sax solo... but to me the album name could be reduced to contain just the last of the three words really. Bland.

  [5.0/10]
