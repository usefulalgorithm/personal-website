## Leyland Kirby - The Death Of Rave (A partial flashback)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1960744180_16.jpg)

  Unsettling ambient tracks sampled from rave tracks. Read an [article from Fact](https://www.factmag.com/2014/06/10/vvm-the-death-of-rave-a-partial-flashback/) that says this album was a dig at the rave scene , and was conceptualized when he went to a famous Berlin club... wild. That last track is very brutal.

  Release date: 2016-01-15

  [8.5/10]

## Richie Culver - I was born by the sea

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4248256935_16.jpg)

  Experimental ambient. At first I wasn't paying attention to the spoken word parts, and then I did, and then I realized how dope this thing is. [Boomkat's recommendation article on this album](https://boomkat.com/products/i-was-born-by-the-sea) is also a pretty good read. 

  Release date: 2022-11-11

  [8.4/10]

## Asian Glow, Weatherday - Weatherglow

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0465346081_16.jpg)

  No idea Weatherday had an EP this year... Really good indie rock. The production quality went up a lot on this one.

  Release date: 2022-03-17

  [8.4/10]

## Ginger Root - Misemono

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27336ae64999d6fe3add9976b82)

  Jazzy bedroom pop funk / city-pop. The chord progressions on this EP is mind blowing.

  Release date: 2022-09-09

  [8.2/10]

## Pole - Tempus

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1292958939_16.jpg)

  Slippery ambient dub techno with piano. I enjoy this.

  Release date: 2022-11-23

  [8.1/10]

## Galya Bisengalieva - Aralkum Aralas

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3544094605_16.jpg)

  Slick experimental electronic music. It's got Moor Mother, Jlin, Actress, Coby Sey on it... pretty wild stuff.

  Release date: 2021-10-15

  [8.1/10]

## Loke Rahbek, Frederik Valetin - Together

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3639414058_16.jpg)

  This is way more club-friendly, way more carefree than `Elephant`. They made this album as a reimagined soundtrack to Chris Marker's documentary.

  Release date: 2022-10-14

  [8.1/10]

## Christinaa Vantzou - No. 5

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1468377957_16.jpg)

  Modern composition. Felt very personal.

  Release date: 2022-11-11

  [8.0/10]

## Cakes da Killa - Svengali

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3379754975_16.jpg)

  House-rap is definitely something I didn't know I'd dig before I heard it. Also the queer theme is still quite prevalent on this one, which is always pretty cool to see.

  Release date: 2022-10-28

  [7.8/10]

## Ashenspire - Hostile Architecture

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0719030390_16.jpg)

  Avant-garde metal. I like the more straight up metal tracks more than the more classical-influenced ones.

  Release date: 2022-07-15

  [7.7/10]

## Franck Vigroux - Magnetoscope

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0117979587_16.jpg)

  Dystopian drum & bass / techno. Infectious sound.

  Release date: 2022-11-25

  [7.5/10]

## Dungen - En Är För Mycket och Tusen Aldrig Nog

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1429532175_16.jpg)

  Psych-pop. It still sounds pretty good, but just feels way too restrained and not all that interesting to me. I dig the track `Var Har Du Varit?` though.

  Release date: 2022-10-07

  [7.2/10]

## Curd Duca - Waves 3

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2332883899_16.jpg)

  This one feels more random than the previous ones. Like a pretty good sample pack, but hard to figure out the overall theme.

  Release date: 2022-04-18

  [6.9/10]

## Roman Flügel - Balmy Evening

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0157255654_16.jpg)

  IDM / minimal house. I enjoy the ambient tracks bu not so much the more upbeat techno tracks.

  Release date: 2022-10-14

  [6.8/10]

## TLF Trio - Sweet Harmony

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1608211832_16.jpg)

  Chamber music / jazz-noir / modern classical.

  Release date: 2022-07-14

  [6.8/10]

## The Umlauts - Another Fact

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2942429492_16.jpg)

  Club influenced post-punk / synth pop. This wouldn't feel out of place if this is in the Cyberpunk anime series.

  Release date: 2022-10-14

  [6.7/10]

## Floating Points - Someone Close

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0142746980_16.jpg)

  This one feels more club-friendly than the other ones from his discography...

  Release date: 2022-11-09

  [6.5/10]

## SZA - SOS

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27370dbc9f47669d120ad874ec1)

  Pop rap. The only song that I really like on this album is definitely `Kill Bill`. The rest are more miss than hit for me.

  Release date: 2022-12-09

  [6.5/10]

## Plaid - Feorm Falorx

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1955552146_16.jpg)

  I was expecting a lot more than this... IDM that feels like some video game's bland OST. It is not horrible, but just kind of half-hearted.

  Release date: 2022-11-11

  [6.0/10]

## Precipitation - Glass Horizon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2151419550_16.jpg)

  Ambient house. Quite unmemorable...

  Release date: 2022-07-29

  [6.0/10]
