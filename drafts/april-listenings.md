## Violet - Transparências

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0108388476_16.jpg)

  Club / ambient. I like the ambient cuts a lot, like the first track `Música para acordar`, but the wonkier tracks on this album are also very fascinating.

  [8.5/10]

## Nala Sinephro - Space 1.8

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2701684768_16.jpg)

  Great contemporary jazz. The last track sounds like Gas with sax on top. Totally missed out on this one last year...

  [8.3/10]

## Ikarus - Plasma

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0841614421_16.jpg)

  Progressive jazz-rock, or just modern zeuhl. Jazzy stuff, didn't know there are still people making this kind of music.

  [7.6/10]

## Oki - Tonkori In The Moonlight

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1480176306_16.jpg)

  The [Bandcamp page](https://oki-tonkori.bandcamp.com/album/tonkori-in-the-moonlight) will basically tell you everything you need to know about this project. As for me anything that comes from Oki's making is guaranteed to be quality stuff.

  [8.3/10]

## Lizzy Mercier Descloux - Mambo Nassou

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273ce0c1ce5b0bcfc340c1f17f2)

  Funk fusion / post-punk. Got to know about this artist through a (review on Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/oki-tonkori-in-the-moonlight-review-ainu-people). Probably will check out other ZE Record artists as well.

  This album is awesome.

  [8.8/10]

## Chat Pile - Remove Your Skin Please

  ![]()

  It's like Godflesh meets Pissed Jeans meets The Body, but different from all of those bands at the same time. Looking forward to their new stuff.

  [8.3/10]

## They Hate Change - Blatant Localism

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/797897/large/617308026665.jpg)

  I think their older tracks are much more fire than those three, when are they going to release a full length album though...

  [7.6/10]

## Saga Asad - New Man

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3493974522_16.jpg)

  Pretty smooth jazz-hop.

  [7.3/10]

## Teller Bank$, Ed Glorious - The Part & Parcel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1685381528_16.jpg)

  Boom bap.

  [7.5/10]

## Booker Stardrum - CRATER

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2642949384_16.jpg)

  Abstract experimental electronic music from L.A. percussionist. Some of the sounds remind me of OPN's `Returnal`. The last track `Walking Through Still Air` is really nice.

  [8.3/10]

## Black Thought - Streams of Thought Vol. 1

  ![]()

  I think this is definitely better than Vol. 2... Conscious rap.

  [8.1/10]
