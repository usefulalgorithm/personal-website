## Pile - All Fiction

  ![]()

  I feel like they've been on a trajectory since `A Hair Shirt of Purpose` from noisy indie rock band that occasionally does insanely catchy but still very playful songs, to right now where they discard that dissonance to a large degree and focus more on Rick's vocal lines.

  [6.6/10]

## Lucinda Chua - Yian

  ![]()

  Wonderful minimalistic modern classical pop. This is so good...

  [8.5/10]

## Carla del Forno - Come Around

  Dub-y bedroom pop / minimal wave. I quite enjoy her previous albums but this one is my favorite yet. Super lo-fi, huge post-punk vibes.

  [8.3/10]

## Tim Hecker - No Highs

  I like the sound on this album. Very subdued.

  [8.1/10]

## Patrick Shiroishi - Evergreen

  Ambient / field recording. To me this is much less focused than the marvellous `Hidemi` from 2021.

  [6.7/10]

## MJ Guider - Temporary Requiem

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1984562409_16.jpg)

  Doomy shoegaze.

  [8.1/10]

## Hedvig Mollestad Trio - Evil in Oslo

  ![]()

  Blues rock / stoner rock. Guitar tone is quite chunky but the virtuosity is just not there IMO.

  [6.0/10]

## Yves Tumor - Praise A Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2855443234_16.jpg)

  R&B / art-rock. With each album release their music gets more grandiose and stadium rock oriented. I don't dislike it but I'd say `Heaven to a Tortured Mind` is the album that achieves the most out of this kind of sound.

  [7.6/10]

## Piotr Kurek - Edena

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3368907623_16.jpg)

  Synth electronic loop music.

  [8.1/10]

## Chunky - Somebody's Child

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2650126951_16.jpg)

  UK rap. Not really feeling it...

  [6.8/10]
