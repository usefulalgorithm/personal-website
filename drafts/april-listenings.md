## Violet - Transparências

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0108388476_16.jpg)

  Club / ambient. I like the ambient cuts a lot, like the first track `Música para acordar`, but the wonkier tracks on this album are also very fascinating.

  [8.5/10]

## Nala Sinephro - Space 1.8

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2701684768_16.jpg)

  Great contemporary jazz. The last track sounds like Gas with sax on top. Totally missed out on this one last year...

  [8.5/10]

## Ikarus - Plasma

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0841614421_16.jpg)

  Progressive jazz-rock, or just modern zeuhl. Jazzy stuff, didn't know there are still people making this kind of music.

  [7.6/10]

## Oki - Tonkori In The Moonlight

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1480176306_16.jpg)

  The [Bandcamp page](https://oki-tonkori.bandcamp.com/album/tonkori-in-the-moonlight) will basically tell you everything you need to know about this project. As for me anything that comes from Oki's making is guaranteed to be quality stuff.

  [8.3/10]

## Lizzy Mercier Descloux - Mambo Nassou

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273ce0c1ce5b0bcfc340c1f17f2)

  Funk fusion / post-punk. Got to know about this artist through a (review on Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/11/oki-tonkori-in-the-moonlight-review-ainu-people). Probably will check out other ZE Record artists as well.

  This album is awesome.

  [8.8/10]

## Chat Pile - Remove Your Skin Please

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1074154568_16.jpg)

  It's like Godflesh meets Pissed Jeans meets The Body, but different from all of those bands at the same time. Looking forward to their new stuff.

  [8.3/10]

## They Hate Change - Blatant Localism

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/797897/large/617308026665.jpg)

  I think their older tracks are much more fire than those three, when are they going to release a full length album though...

  [7.5/10]

## Saga Asad - New Man

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3493974522_16.jpg)

  Pretty smooth jazz-hop.

  [7.1/10]

## Teller Bank$, Ed Glorious - The Part & Parcel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1685381528_16.jpg)

  Boom bap.

  [7.3/10]

## Booker Stardrum - CRATER

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2642949384_16.jpg)

  Abstract experimental electronic music from L.A. percussionist. Some of the sounds remind me of OPN's `Returnal`. The last track `Walking Through Still Air` is really nice.

  [8.3/10]

## Black Thought - Streams of Thought Vol. 1

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273aa3711fb2ed2e12a34bf1402)

  I think this is definitely better than Vol. 2... Conscious rap.

  [8.1/10]

## Soul Glo - Diaspora Problems

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3168552135_16.jpg)

  Hardcore punk + rap... Hardcore rap?? Pretty fun stuff.

  [7.2/10]

## The Silver - Ward of Roses

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3370981599_16.jpg)

  Alright black metal. The tones are pretty decent, but in terms of songwriting it isn't exactly what I'd call innovative or refreshing.

  [7.0/10]

## Patrick Shiroishi - Hidemi

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2008197316_16.jpg)

  Jazz concept album. Mesmerizing.

  [8.2/10]

## ROSALÍA - MOTOMAMI

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2730c179967a265de0fc76382fe)

  Bombastic reggaeton.

  [7.8/10]

## Pixel - The Drive

  ![](https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/7d/5c/88/mzi.zqorawqk.tif/1200x1200bf-60.jpg)

  Minimal electronic music from raster-noton. Normally when you see them publish something you should just check it out, chances are it's gonna be lit.

  [8.5/10]

## Yage - 3 17 October 1984

  ![](https://cdn2.albumoftheyear.org/500x/album/413235-3-17-october-1984.jpg)

  ~_~ I really like screamo music ~_~

  [8.6/10]

## Tomas Fujiwara's Triple Double - March

  ![]()

  Free jazz.

  [7.5/10]

## SeeYouSpaceCowboy - The Romance of Affliction

  ![]()

  And I thought everyone stopped doing pop metalcore a long time ago...

  [4.0/10]

## Ka Baird, Pekka Airaksinen - FRKWYS Vol. 17: Hungry Shells

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1513811650_16.jpg)

  Eerie experimental album. A bit difficult at first but gets better over repeated listening at work.

  [7.8/10]

## Denzel Curry - Melt My Eyez See Your Future

  ![]()

  I never expected a jazz-hop album from him...

  [8.2/10]
