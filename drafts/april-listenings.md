## Lucinda Chua - Yian

  ![]()

  Wonderful minimalistic modern classical pop. This is so good...

  [8.5/10]

## Carla del Forno - Come Around

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2354721515_16.jpg)

  Dub-y bedroom pop / minimal wave. I quite enjoy her previous albums but this one is my favorite yet. Super lo-fi, huge post-punk vibes.

  [8.3/10]

## Tim Hecker - No Highs
