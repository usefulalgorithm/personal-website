## 2021 Releases

### Pavel Milyakov & Bendik Giske - Pavel Milyakov & Bendik Giske

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/729232/large/7072822375010_T70860909550054.jpeg)

  Abrasive jazz ambient. Some time ago I thought Giske was on the path to become a second Colin Stetson, turns out he was even more experimental in terms of timbre and composition. Milyakov is actually Buttechno, and here he adds a deep, absorbing electronic layer underneath the sax that occasionally burst out into the front stage. Truely next level music.

  [8.9/10]

### Godspeed You! Black Emperor - G_d's Pee AT STATE'S END!

  ![]()

  OMG

  [8.8/10]

### Armand Hammer, The Alchemist - Haram

  ![]()

  Elucid and billy wood are (still) on the top of the game. Downtempo, dark jazz-ish instrumentals from The Alchemist are dope AF as well. Really good stuff.

  [8.6/10]

### Amulets - Blooming

  Awesome fuzzy ambient album.

  [8.6/10]

### Various Artists - La Ola Interior (Spanish Ambient & Acid Exotism: 1983 - 1990)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0240779806_16.jpg)

  I can listen to this all day long.

  [8.5/10]

### Andy Stott - Never The Right Time

  ![]()

  Downtempo / minimalistic electronic beat music. I actually like this quite a bit, it's got a nostalgic, somber feeling throughout the entire album.

  [8.3/10]

### Minimal Violence - Phase Two

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1514079938_10.jpg)

  Drum & Bass / EBM. Pulverizing tunes that make you shake your head off.

  [8.0/10]

### Stereolab - Electrically Possessed [Switched On Volume 4]

  ![]()

  I enjoy the longer, drone-ier songs a lot.

  [7.8/10]

### Benny The Butcher, Harry Fraud - The Plugs I Met 2

  ![]()

  East-coast hip-hop. Pretty good but not something that really leaves an impression. People say The Plugs I Met hits harder than this one though.

  [7.7/10]

### Feu! Chatterton - Palais d'argile

  ![]()

  Psychedelic chansson... some tracks like `La Mer` and `Libre` are pretty rockin'.

  [7.5/10]

### Xiu Xiu - OH NO

  ![]()

  Their most pop oriented release to date. Honestly not that into this one compared to their other recent stuff.

  [6.5/10]

## 2019 Releases

### Benny The Butcher - The Plugs I Met

  ![]()

  This is indeed much more memorable than its sequel. Some Wu-Tang level stuff.

  [8.4/10]

### Hakushi Hasegawa - Air Ni Ni

  ![]()

  Off-kilter jazzy j-pop.

  [8.2/10]

## 2018 Releases

### Teresa Winter - What The Night Is For

  ![]()

  Eerie, sprawling modern composition / electronic. Like the first track.
