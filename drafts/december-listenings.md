## Klein - Harmattan

  Modern composition. Eerie stuff,

## Arca - KicK iii

  ![]()

  I like this way more than last year's `KiCk I`, which felt way too ritualisitic. This album strikes the perfect balance between Arca's works for the last couple of years, and more club friendly, more danceable electronic music. Good stuff...

  [8.7/10]

## Arca - KICK ii

  ![]()

  This feels like it's the link between `KicK iii` and `KiCk I`. I like the track `Confianza` a lot but the others feel a bit tame (compared with `KicK iii`.)

  [7.8/10]

## Fluxion - Parallel Moves

  OK dub techno.

  [7.2/10]

## Susumu Yokota - Magic Thread

  ![]()

  I always thought he only did ambient work, turns out this is a really decent minimal techno record... FFO Jan Jelinek.

  [8.8/10]
