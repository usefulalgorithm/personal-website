## Klein - Harmattan

  Modern composition. Eerie stuff,

## Arca - KicK iii

  ![]()

  I like this way more than last year's `KiCk I`, which felt way too ritualisitic. This album strikes the perfect balance between Arca's works for the last couple of years, and more club friendly, more danceable electronic music. Good stuff...

  [8.7/10]

## Arca - KICK ii

  ![]()

  This feels like it's the link between `KicK iii` and `KiCk I`. I like the track `Confianza` a lot but the others feel a bit tame (compared with `KicK iii`.)

  [7.8/10]

## Fluxion - Parallel Moves

  OK dub techno.

  [7.2/10]

## Susumu Yokota - Magic Thread

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3258085063_16.jpg)

  I always thought he only did ambient work, turns out this is a really decent minimal techno record... FFO Jan Jelinek.

  [8.8/10]

## GAS - Der Lange Marsch

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3367308465_16.jpg)

  This is more in line with `Rausch` than `Pop`, though some snippets of the latter can be found in this album quite easily. I guess it kind of makes sense, with the rumor that this is the final album under the GAS moniker... The steady bass drum makes this album feel unnerving, even with the synths doing major chord pads.

  [7.6/10]

## Rival Consoles - Overflow

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0190906826_16.jpg)

  Dub techno / IDM. It is not bad but also not all that interesting, and the philosophy references don't really help...

  [7.3/10]

## Lyra Pramuk - Delta

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1839035626_16.jpg)

  A compilation of remixed versions of the songs from 2020's `Fountain`, and some collaborative materials between Pramuk and artists such as Kara-Lis Coverdale and KMRU. I really like the `Tendril` rework from Hudson Mohawke...

  [8.2/10]

## Sega Bodega - Romeo

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0790768225_16.jpg)

  Not as bombastic as his previous record, but still pretty dope.

  [8.1/10]
