## 2020 Releases

### William Basinski - Lamentations

  ![]()

  [9.1/10]

### Meitei - Kofū

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3633290297_10.jpg)

  This is what happens if someone decides to make Lo-Fi Hip-Hop-ized ambient.

  [8.9/10]

### Pyrrhon - Abscess Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1103101609_10.jpg)

  This is some Gortuts level stuff.

  [8.6/10]

### Asetias - False Peace

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0210308449_10.jpg)

  Thrashy death metal. This bad boy is super vicious.

  [8.6/10]

### Phew - Vertigo KO

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3753488872_10.jpg)

  Dream-like music. Drone? Glitchy electronic post-punk? A Closer Listen ranked this as one of their top 10 experimental releases of 2020. Though I think they're too heavily into post-rock most of the time they're absolutely right in selecting this album.

  [8.5/10]

### FUJI||||||||||TA - Iki

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4135375055_10.jpg)

  Slow, soothing pipe organ ambient / field recording. I love this kind of stuff.

  [8.4/10]

### Jessie Ware - What's Your Pleasure?

  ![]()

  Awesome city pop.

  [8.4/10]

### Loma - Don’t Shy Away

  ![]()

  Gloomy, minimalistic indie pop. Brian eno played on the last track. 好聽

  [8.3/10]

### The Koreantown Oddity - Little Dominiques Nosebleed

  ![]()

  Dope jazz-hop.

  [8.3/10]

### MIKE - Weight Of The World

  ![]()

  Very enjoyable lo-fi hip-hop. Reminds me of Madvillainy for some reason.

  [8.2/10]

### Black Wing - No Moon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0327304830_10.jpg)

  FFO Have A Nice Life's Deathconciousness. Well it's basically the guy behind HANL so yeah...

  [8.2/10]

### Sturgil Simpson - Cuttin' Grass Vol. 2

  ![]()

  Great bluegrass / country music by one of the genre's most consistent artists.

  [8.1/10]

### They hate change - 666 Central Ave.

  ![]()

  Kings of bedroom drum n bass rap are still on their streak.

  [8.1/10]

### U - Lowlands

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1107200968_10.jpg)

  It's got folk, it's got lo-fi techno, it's got ambient... pretty good stuff.

  [8.0/10]

### JPEGMAFIA - EP!

  ![]()

  Pretty good but this feels more like a treaser to something.

  [7.8/10]

### 萬能青年旅店 - 冀西南林路行

  ![]()

  Jazz rock / folk rock / prog. This album feels like one single song played in different speed, chords, and interspersed with solos. Or just a really really long song? Either way I find this album less enticing than their first album, but then it is indeed a well-crafted album.

  Fav tracks: 採石, 泥河 

  [7.8/10]

### Riki - Riki

  ![]()

  Synth pop / retrowave. Pretty old school stuff.

  [7.6/10]

### Unwed sailor - Look Alive

  ![]()

  Instrumental post punk? Danceable post rock? Either way the album started out pretty refreshing but gradually lost its shine. Nevertheless it’s a pretty interesting release I’ll say.

  [7.4/10]

### Inter Arma - Garber Days Revisited

  ![]()

  Established doom metal band does a cover album. March Of The Pigs is pretty dope.

  [7.2/10]

### Crippled Black Phoenix - Ellengæst

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0860546796_10.jpg)

  Proggy hard rock / doom rock. I'd say CBP circa I, Vigilante is the best though.

  [7.0/10]

### Primitive Man - Immersion

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0160033873_10.jpg)

  Though this album is super heavy I feel a lot of the tracks are kind of like slowed down versions of Full Of Hell materials. Gets kind of monotonous after a while IMO.

  [7.0/10]

### Various Artists - Nick Luscombe Presents Tokyo Dreaming

  ![]()

  Lotsa Japanese music big names are in this compilation, but a lot of them are outdated pop music with soaring lead guitar solos.

  [6.7/10]

### Pinegrove - Marigold

  ![]()

  DCFC-ish indie rock. Last track is a pretty expansive drone / post rock track but others are just ok.

  [6.5/10]

### Kid Cudi - Man On The Moon III: The Chosen

  ![]()

  Even his best album to date sounds only OK-ish.

  [6.4/10]

### Pallbearer - Forgotten Days

  ![]()

  Its all down tuned doom metal in a minor with clean vocals. I’d say it’s definitely on the boring side.

  [5.5/10]
