## Klein - Harmattan

## Arca - KicK iii

  ![]()

  I like this way more than last year's `KiCk I`, which felt way too ritualisitic. This album strikes the perfect balance between Arca's works for the last couple of years, and more club friendly, more danceable electronic music. Good stuff...

  [8.7/10]

## Arca - KICK ii

  ![]()

  This feels like it's the link between `KicK iii` and `KiCk I`. I like the track `Confianza` a lot but the others feel a bit tame (compared with `KicK iii`.)

  [7.8/10]
