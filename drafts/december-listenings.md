## Christinaa Vantzou - No. 5

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1468377957_16.jpg)

  Modern composition. Felt very personal.

  [8.0]

## Franck Vigroux - Magnetoscope

  Dystopian drum & bass / techno. Infectious sound.

  [7.5/10]

## Plaid - Feorm Falorx

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1955552146_16.jpg)

  I was expecting a lot more than this... IDM that feels like some video game's bland OST. It is not horrible, but just kind of half-hearted.

  [6.0/10]

## Dungen - En Är För Mycket och Tusen Aldrig Nog

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1429532175_16.jpg)

  Psych-pop. It still sounds pretty good, but just feels way too restrained and not all that interesting to me. I dig the track `Var Har Du Varit?` though.

  [7.2/10]

## Cakes da Killa - Svengali
