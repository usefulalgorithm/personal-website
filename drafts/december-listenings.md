## Christinaa Vantzou - No. 5

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1468377957_16.jpg)

  Modern composition. Felt very personal.

  [8.0]

## Franck Vigroux - Magnetoscope

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0117979587_16.jpg)

  Dystopian drum & bass / techno. Infectious sound.

  [7.5/10]

## Plaid - Feorm Falorx

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1955552146_16.jpg)

  I was expecting a lot more than this... IDM that feels like some video game's bland OST. It is not horrible, but just kind of half-hearted.

  [6.0/10]

## Dungen - En Är För Mycket och Tusen Aldrig Nog

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1429532175_16.jpg)

  Psych-pop. It still sounds pretty good, but just feels way too restrained and not all that interesting to me. I dig the track `Var Har Du Varit?` though.

  [7.2/10]

## Pole - Tempus

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1292958939_16.jpg)

  Slippery ambient dub techno with piano. I enjoy this.

  [8.1/10]

## Cakes da Killa - Svengali

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3379754975_16.jpg)

  House-rap is definitely something I didn't know I'd dig before I heard it. Also the queer theme is still quite prevalent on this one, which is always pretty cool to see.

  [7.8/10]

## Ashenspire - Hostile Architecture

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0719030390_16.jpg)

  Avant-garde metal. I like the more straight up metal tracks more than the more classical-influenced ones.

  [7.7/10]

## Curd Duca - Waves 3

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2332883899_16.jpg)

  This one feels more random than the previous ones. Like a pretty good sample pack, but hard to figure out the overall theme.

  [6.9/10]

## Roman Flügel - Balmy Evening

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0157255654_16.jpg)

  IDM / minimal house. I enjoy the ambient tracks bu not so much the more upbeat techno tracks.

  [6.8/10]

## Leyland Kirby - The Death Of Rave (A partial flashback)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1960744180_16.jpg)

  Unsettling ambient tracks sampled from rave tracks. Read an [article from Fact](https://www.factmag.com/2014/06/10/vvm-the-death-of-rave-a-partial-flashback/) that says this album was a dig at the rave scene , and was conceptualized when he went to a famous Berlin club... wild. That last track is very brutal.

  [8.5/10]
