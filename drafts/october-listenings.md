## Klara Lewis & Nik Colk Void - Full On

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2408292926_16.jpg)

  FFO Curd Duca, Actress. Abstract collage music.

  [8.3/10]

## Oneohtrix Point Never - Again

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4277554650_16.jpg)

  Compared to his earlier stuff this is extremely safe.

  [6.8/10]

## James Blake - Playing Robots Into Heaven

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273921f7aa6349a070b6f26b3ff)

  UK garage. While I still don’t really dig the minimal dubstep / r&b fusion sound he’s going for all that much, this is a breath of fresh air compared with his previous more pop oriented albums. 

  [6.1/10]

## Eartheater - Powder

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2558704024_16.jpg)

  Art pop / experimental R&B. I think there are just too many producers on this album, making this album lacking a bit in terms of songwriting coherence, and sounding more like it’s from a generic pop artist that claims to be avant garde but doesn’t really know what they’re doing. There are cool tracks here and there, but as a whole it’s just a bit too all over the place.

  [6.6/10]

## McKinley Dixon - Beloved! Paradise! Jazz?

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1333962670_16.jpg)

  Jazz-rap / conscious hip-hop. A great album! Awesome jazz beats and awesome lyrics.

  [8.3/10]

## Various Artists - V4 Visions: Of Love & Androids

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0365594782_16.jpg)

  House / funk / R&B. Basically 90's music. I like the R&B cuts on the first disc.

  [7.6/10]

## SG - For Lovers Only / Rain Suite

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2882953685_16.jpg)

  It's like the [Knobs](https://www.youtube.com/@Knobs) or [collector//emitter](https://www.youtube.com/@collectoremitter) pedal demos extended to be a standalone album. Dreamy lo-fi guitar ambient music.

  [8.2/10]

## Lee Gamble - Models

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2394588006_16.jpg)

  Ambient pop. The vocals on this album is generated by AI. The theme he's exploring on this album is very Hauntological, but I'd say it's something one have to do some extra digging to find out.

  [6.7/10]

## Maral - Ground Groove

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2500288567_16.jpg)

  Sprawling lo-fi industrial dub, or "folk club" as the artist described her music. Maral is an Iranian-American artist, and a lot of the samples on this album is from her personal archive of Iranian folk, pop & classical albums.
  
  [8.2/10]

## Sofia Kourtesis - Madres

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4189602856_16.jpg)

  Club-friendly electro-pop.

  [6.3/10]

## Sprain - Lamb as Effigy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0587477614_16.jpg)

  Experimental post-noise rock / drone. Strong AOTY candidate.

  [9.1/10]

## The Armed - Perfect Saviors

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2690079050_16.jpg)

  Poppy alternative punk. Not nearly as explosive as `Ultrapop`, instead this is much more in line with the usual alt-rock path.

  [7.3/10]

## Shygirl - Nymphs

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2087620991_16.jpg)

  Hypnogogic R&B / trap. FFO Sega Bodega.

  [8.3/10]

## Marica BC - Spike Field

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0787557467_16.jpg)

  Spectral, melancholic dream pop / folk. Compared to `Hyaline` this one features lusher instrumentation and is overall better produced. The songs are incredibly well written. Great album! FFO Grouper and Midwife.

  [8.4/10]

## Model/Actriz - Dogsbody

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2228512258_16.jpg)

  Angular post-punk. I like the last track, which is the most tranquil track among the album.

  [8.0/10]

## Sampha - Lahai

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1179241798_16.jpg)

  I love basically every track on this album.  

  [8.6/10]
