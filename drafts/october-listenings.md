## Joy Orbison - Still Slipping Vol. 1

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3780752321_16.jpg)

  Pleasant techno / UK bass. FFO Mount Kimbie & St. Germaine (kind of...). I think this is one of the most balanced techno records I've heard this year...

  [8.5/10]

## Audiobook - Astro Tough

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2348048798_16.jpg)

  Weird indie pop. I feel like the first and the last couple of songs are very different from the ones in the middle - the former more dance oriented, while the latter features more traditional instrumentation.

  [6.7/10]

## Miguel A. Ruiz - Climatery

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1063488858_16.jpg)

  Hazy ambient. Feels like an Apichatpong film...

  [8.3/10]

## Priya Ragu - damnshestamil

  ![](https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/priya-rague-damnshestamil.jpg)

  Pop mixtape from Indian / Swiss artist. A lot of Indian sounding elements on this album.

  [6.7/10]

## Tara Clerkin Trio - In Spring

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4036176491_16.jpg)

  Lo-fi chamber noir-jazz / downtempo.

  [8.1/10]

## Joyer - Perfect Gray

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3007159989_16.jpg)

  Slowcore. I feel like it's all the same song on the entire album...

  [6.5/10]

## Sarah Davachi - Antiphonals

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4039785823_16.jpg)

  Drone / modern composition. Think taking a walk in an abandoned temple that has yet to decay into a ruin, and this is the music you'd hear in your head even if there's really no one else around you.

  [8.5/10]

## Call Super - Cherry Drops I

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0849479265_16.jpg)

  Techno / house. Sounds like floating in mid air. I like it way better than last year's full length LP.

  [8.4/10]

## Two Shell - SoulCity EP

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1886135320_16.jpg)

  Techno / bass. I like the second track Soft Core the most, the others aren't really that impressive. Must be total bangers in a club though.

  [7.3/10]

## Kit Downes, Lucy Railton - Subaerial

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1357394912_16.jpg)

  Modern composition. This is some spooky music... But the more I listen to it the more I feel drawn to it.

  [8.1/10]

## M. Sage with The Spinnaker Ensemble - The Wind Of Things

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3042589163_16.jpg)

  Organic, brooding ambient / field recording.

  [7.8/10]
