## billy woods - Church

  Not as groundbreaking as `Aethiopes`, but the sick bars are still here.

  [8.0/10]

## Mamaleek - Diner Coffee

  Noir-jazz meets sludge metal. This is a strong year for The Flenser for sure. `Come and See` from two years ago was one of my favorite albums from that year, and this tops that.

  [8.8/10]

## Tarotplane - Aeonium

  Psychedelic synth ambient. Not as impactful or fun as last year's `Horizontology` (love that one soooo much).

  [7.8/10]

## Sam Prekop, John McEntire - Sons Of
