## Joy Orbison - Still Slipping Vol. 1

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3780752321_16.jpg)

  Pleasant techno / UK bass. FFO Mount Kimbie & St. Germaine (kind of...). I think this is one of the most balanced techno records I've heard this year...

  [8.5/10]

## Audiobook - Astro Tough

  Weird indie pop. I feel like the first and the last couple of songs are very different from the ones in the middle - the former more dance oriented, while the latter features more traditional instrumentation.

  [6.7/10]

## Miguel A. Ruiz - Climatery

  Hazy ambient. Feels like an Apichatpong film...

  [8.3/10]

## Priya Ragu - damnshestamil

  Pop mixtape from Indian / Swiss artist. A lot of Indian sounding elements on this album.

  [6.7/10]
