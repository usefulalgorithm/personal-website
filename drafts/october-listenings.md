## billy woods - Church

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0173383682_16.jpg)

  Not as groundbreaking as `Aethiopes`, but the sick bars are still here.

  [8.0/10]

## Mamaleek - Diner Coffee

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0957239885_16.jpg)

  Noir-jazz meets sludge metal. This is a strong year for The Flenser for sure. `Come and See` from two years ago was one of my favorite albums from that year, and this tops that.

  [8.8/10]

## Tarotplane - Aeonium

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1504159902_16.jpg)

  Psychedelic synth ambient. Not as impactful or fun as last year's `Horizontology` (love that one soooo much).

  [7.8/10]

## Liturgy - As the Blood of God Bursts the Veins of Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1585766490_16.jpg)

  There are heavy, groovy riffs here and there but overall this is stuff that makes you feel like you kind of wish Greg Fox is still on the squad...

  [7.3/10]

## Om Unit - Acid Dub Studies

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1148596880_16.jpg)

  I feel like Vol. 2 is more exciting than this one. Maybe because they've studied more?

  [7.7/10]

## The Mars Volta - The Mars Volta

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273b491788f3f3bbae0db5763b9)

  The greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment......

  [3.0/10]

## Loraine James - Build Something Beautiful for Me

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2913304085_16.jpg)

  Probably her most accessible work to date.

  [8.4/10]

## City of Caterpillar - Mystic Sisters

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2738d6add46435825a4a4736437)

  After 20 something years the screamo legends decide to do it one more time. This is not as amazing as their full-length album, but it's one that makes me expect whatever they're gonna do next.

  [7.6/10]

## Jigen - Blood's Finality

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0408899137_16.jpg)

  Chopped-up techno / drum & bass. This is very dope...

  [8.5/10]

## Mister Water Wet - Significant Soil

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2117289870_16.jpg)

  Ambient (from afro-cuban jazz ambient, to illbient, to field recordig). This is a lot of fun to listen to.

  [8.3/10]

## T. Gowdy - Miracles

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0850045826_16.jpg)

  IDM. Or as Boomkat puts it post-techno. Dig the sounds in this album.

  [8.2/10]

## Cult of Luna - The Long Road North

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4229333320_16.jpg)

  I think CoL is one of those bands that I don't really expect nor follow closely, but when I stumble upon their new stuff it's always something pretty good...

  [7.8/10]

## Ian William Craig - Music for Magnesium 173

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3569106764_16.jpg)

  Man I gotta play the game.

  [8.1/10]

## Nobukazu Takemura - Hoshi No Koe

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2434490830_16.jpg)

  Glitchy ambient, kind of like Susumu Yokota. I enjoy this very much.

  [8.6/10]

## Lightning in a Twilight Hour - Overwintering

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4119177453_16.jpg)

  Soothing indie-folk / dream-pop.

  [8.1/10]

## Arctic Monkey - The Car

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27307823ee6237208c835802663)

  If you can hear disappointing this is it.

  [4.5/10]

## Sam Prekop, John McEntire - Sons Of

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2022675075_16.jpg)

  Duo of former The Sea & Cake bandmates do a house record. Pretty fun to listen to but probably not something I'd revisit.

  [7.4/10]

## Steve Bates - All the Things That Happen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2663050430_16.jpg)

  Fuzzy droning ambient / noise. Very immersive music, I like it a lot. 

  [8.4/10]

## Hattori Takashi - Moon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3856115128_16.jpg)

  Somehow I thought about video game soundtracks a lot when I was listening to this album... Psyched out experimental new age?

  [8.3/10]

## quiqui - もう少しの暦

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1675563382_16.jpg)

  IMO they're the most overlooked band in Japan, super dope skramz.

  [8.5/10]

## Iota Phi - Homo Pauperis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1518634432_16.jpg)
  
  Art-pop with dystopian lyrical themes. Quite enjoyable, but not especially memorable...

  [7.6/10]

## Makaya McCraven - In These Times

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3992958598_16.jpg)

  Modern nu-jazz / fusion. Got vibes but personally not really that exciting...
  
  [7.4/10]
