## Krallice - Porous Resonance Abyss

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0071864209_16.jpg)

  It's Krallice doing John Carpenter music. Pretty weird when you think about it... I would say this is more atmospheric than their previous stuff, it's not like the past albums aren't but on this album I get the impression that they're consciously pushing for that. In a sense it is probably their most proggy album? Or maybe it is just the synth...

  [8.2/10]

## Jockstrap - I Love You Jennifer B

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0869591723_16.jpg)

  Awesome pop album.

  [8.3/10]

## Blur - The Ballad of Darren

  ![]()

  When middle age dudes want to prove their relevance by doing whatever they're doing when they're much younger it's called dad rock. Speaking in terms of music genre this is not dad rock, but aethestically this is exactly that.

  [5.4/10]

## Doon Kanda - Celeste

  ![]()

  No wonky classically influenced dance floor music, just straight up solo classical piano on this one.

  [7.4/10]

## Kelela - Raven

  Alternative R&B / electronica. It's very good.

  [8.4/10]

## The Sound of Animals Fighting - Apeshit

  ![]()

  I still love `The Ocean and the Sun`, but this one is really... underwhelming.

  [5.0/10]

## Dustin Wong - Perpetual Morphosis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3525553174_16.jpg)

  Loopy new-age ambient electronic. FFO Kankyo Ongaku.

  [8.1/10]

## Jan Jelinek - SEASCAPE polyptych

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0725011226_16.jpg)

  The maestro drops the latter word of minimal techno altogether and focuses on abstract museum music. I can appreciate this one more than the other abstract stuff he did in the past though.

  [7.8/10]

## Jeromes Dream - The Gray in Between

  ![]()

  On one hand it is great to see a band come back and is doing stuff just as raw and aggressive as before, on the other hand it sounds too much like Loma Prieta, especially the guitar noises.

  [7.5/10]

## Machine Woman - In the Basement of 83 Men

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0472870516_16.jpg)

  Minimal techno.

  [6.8/10]

## Headache - The Head Hurts but the Heart Knows the Truth

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3814760352_16.jpg)

  Spoken word / trip-hop. It's not the most complex lyrics ever but it fits quite well with the instrumentals. Vegyn certainly doesn't miss.

  [8.1/10]
