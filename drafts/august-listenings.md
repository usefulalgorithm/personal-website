## Krallice - Porous Resonance Abyss

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0071864209_16.jpg)

  It's Krallice doing John Carpenter music. Pretty weird when you think about it... I would say this is more atmospheric than their previous stuff, it's not like the past albums aren't but on this album I get the impression that they're consciously pushing for that. In a sense it is probably their most proggy album? Or maybe it is just the synth...

  [8.2/10]

## Jockstrap - I Love You Jennifer B

  ![]()

  Awesome pop album.

  [8.3/10]

## Blur - The Ballad of Darren

  ![]()

  When middle age dudes want to prove their relevance by doing whatever they're doing when they're much younger it's called dad rock. Speaking in terms of music genre this is not dad rock, but aethestically this is exactly that.

  [5.4/10]

## Doon Kanda - Celeste

  ![]()

  No wonky classically influenced dance floor music, just straight up solo classical piano on this one.

  [7.4/10]

## Kelela - Raven

  Alternative R&B / electronica. It's very good.

  [8.4/10]
