## Krallice - Demonic Wealth

  ![]()

  Less prog-oriented and more traditional black metal / thrash sounding. I appreciate the proggier side of them more though. Sometimes it sounds like Botanist?

  [7.1/10]

## OMSB - Monkey

  Japanese hardcore rap. I like the first track, others not so much.

  [6.7/10]

## Tomasz Bednarczyk - Nothing Much Happens

  ![]()

  Ambient. If you don't like this I guess we probably can't really be friends...

  [9.0/10]

## Code - Flyblown Prince

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1725065026_10.jpg)

  I have never heard of Cradle Of Filth. I imagine this is what CoF sounds like, or if CoF listened to a lot of Arcturus... The high pitched clean vocals are really too silly.

  [6.3/10]

## Koeosaeme - Sonorant

  ![]()

  Futuristic breakcore / cut-n-paste electronic music. Pretty cool.

  [7.6/10]

## Sharkula, Mukqs - Take Caution On The Beach

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1866850706_16.jpg)

  Experimental hip-hop. Really weird stuff, but I guess what else would you expect from a Hausu Mountain release? I like the wonky instrumentals but the vocals are really throwing me off.

  [7.2/10]

## Mika Vainio - 25082016235210179 (Live at Berlin Atonal)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0717980544_16.jpg)

  I don't understand... Sparwling drone / noise music and occasional loud feedback sounds.

  [6.8/10]

## King Woman - Celestial Blues

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2710254350_16.jpg)

  Doom metal / heavy rock. I dig it.

  [8.1/10]

## Oxhy - Respite Unoffered

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273c487507f54a60d0fca6291ff)

  Eerie deconstructed club / hardcore. Pretty cool sound.

  [7.8/10]

## Not Waving, Romance - Eyes Of Fate

  ![]()

  Serene modern classical / ambient. I love it.

  [8.6/10]

## Black Thought, Salaam Remi - Streams Of Thought Vol. 2

  ![]()

  Old school hip-hop.

  [7.1/10]

## Kanye West - 808s & Heartbreak

  ![]()

  This is actually the first time I heard this album... the instrumentals are alright, but the lyrics is what makes this project such a disappointment - it is at best silly, at worst straight up idiotic. The autotune-d vocals does not help at all.

  [5.3/10]

## Body Sculptures - A Body Turns To Eden

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3042064643_16.jpg)

  Industrial ambient / drone music.

  [8.3/10]
