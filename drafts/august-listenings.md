## Shelley Parker - Wisteria

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1562368539_16.jpg)

  Wonky drum & bass / ambient. Always love me some real good, headbangin' DnB.

  [8.2/10]

## Clube Tormanta - O Som Do Labirinto OST

  ![]()

  Ambient OST for some experimental film. The ambient tracks are pretty spooky, and then there's one oddball heavy metal track. Not really sure why it's there but it's definitely an interesting choice.

  [7.6/10]

## Arpanet - Quantum Tansposition

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4228065150_10.jpg)

  Minimal techno that focuses on quantum physics. This is one of the more left field stuff out there, like it.

  [8.1/10]

## Moor Mother - Jazz Codes

  Nowadays jazz-hop has become something that whole bunch of artists do but you rarely get really good stuff from. Well I guess it's debatable whether this counts as jazz-hop... nevertheless this is Moor Mother's most (probably) easily approachable album to date. As for me I like the first track, which is probably the track with least jazz influence...

  [7.6/10]

## Janel Leppin - Sister Mirror

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2994591663_16.jpg)

  Modern classical featuring eerie cello and melodic pedal steel. I like how this album is abundant with both unsettling moments and enticing melodies.

  [7.7/10]

## KMRU, Aho Ssan - Limen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1982655657_16.jpg)

  Another stellar release from KMRU. This one reminds me of Ben Frost's music more than his usual ambient output. Real heavy.

  [8.3/10]
