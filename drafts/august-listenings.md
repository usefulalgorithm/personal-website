## Krallice - Demonic Wealth

  ![]()

  Less prog-oriented and more traditional black metal / thrash sounding. I appreciate the proggier side of them more though. Sometimes it sounds like Botanist?

  [7.1/10]

## OMSB - Monkey

  Japanese hardcore rap. I like the first track, others not so much.

  [6.7/10]

## Tomasz Bednarczyk - Nothing Much Happens

  ![]()

  Ambient. If you don't like this I guess we probably can't really be friends...

  [9.0/10]

## Code - Flyblown Prince

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1725065026_10.jpg)

  I have never heard of Cradle Of Filth. I imagine this is what CoF sounds like, or if CoF listened to a lot of Arcturus... The high pitched clean vocals are really too silly.

  [6.3/10]
