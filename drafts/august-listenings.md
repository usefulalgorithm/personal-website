## Shelley Parker - Wisteria

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1562368539_16.jpg)

  Wonky drum & bass / ambient. Always love me some real good, headbangin' DnB.

  [8.2/10]

## Clube Tormanta - O Som Do Labirinto OST

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1607064804_16.jpg)

  Ambient OST for some experimental film. The ambient tracks are pretty spooky, and then there's one oddball heavy metal track. Not really sure why it's there but it's definitely an interesting choice.

  [7.6/10]

## Arpanet - Quantum Tansposition

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4228065150_10.jpg)

  Minimal techno that focuses on quantum physics. This is one of the more left field stuff out there, like it.

  [8.1/10]

## Moor Mother - Jazz Codes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4226674197_16.jpg)

  Nowadays jazz-hop has become something that whole bunch of artists do but you rarely get really good stuff from. Well I guess it's debatable whether this counts as jazz-hop... nevertheless this is Moor Mother's most (probably) easily approachable album to date. As for me I like the first track, which is probably the track with least jazz influence...

  [7.6/10]

## Janel Leppin - Sister Mirror

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2994591663_16.jpg)

  Modern classical featuring eerie cello and melodic pedal steel. I like how this album is abundant with both unsettling moments and enticing melodies.

  [7.7/10]

## KMRU, Aho Ssan - Limen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1982655657_16.jpg)

  Another stellar release from KMRU. This one reminds me of Ben Frost's music more than his usual ambient output. Real heavy.

  [8.3/10]

## Shackleton - The Majestic Yes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1502113690_16.jpg)

  Jungle / dub. I find this to be a bit too repetitive to my likings, maybe it'll grow on me...

  [7.2/10]

## Hudson Mohawke - Cry Sugar

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3366499892_16.jpg)

  A hyper-pop album that's fun to listen to.

  [8.1/10]

## Harvey Sutherland - Boy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3582800648_16.jpg)

  Upbeat disco / funk. Dig this stuff a lot, thoroughly enjoyable.

  [8.2/10]

## Russian Circles - Gnosis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3950455291_16.jpg)

  Probably their most repetitive album to date, and it's not like I hold their last two albums in a high place or anything. Sad to see their creativity dip after the release of `Memorial` still continuing to this day.

  [5.0/10]

## Marina Herlop - Pripyat

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3601398248_16.jpg)

  Mystical, abstract vocal music / ambient. I like this a lot, and I bt whoever likes Jenny Hval and Lyra Pramuk would too.

  [8.6/10]

## Cheri Knight - American Rituals

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2576469504_16.jpg)

  Playful experimental music from the 80's. This is somewhat reminiscent of Yasuaki Shimizu's stuff... at least to me.

  [7.7/10]

## Various Artists - Sounds from the Iranian Ultraverse
