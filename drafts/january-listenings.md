## Chris Herbert - Mezzotint

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1383129056_16.jpg)

  Ambient album from Kranky from 2006. Listening to this album I'd imagine the concept of time has ceased to exist, or maybe that's what really good drone music does?

  Cool thing about this album is that Chris Herbert is not a professinal musician: calls himself a non-musician, and all this music is composed of samples and bits retrieved while he's at his day job. Yet this album feels not any less than the works of ambient greats in terms of completeness.

  [8.7/10]

## Various Artists - 滾石40撞樂隊 40團拼經典

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/playlist/global/72234487v2/cropresize/600x600.jpg)

  There are 30 songs in this album but only 5 of them are good... I like Sunset Rollercoaster's cover a lot though, the bassist played his mind out on that track. (Update: there are 40. I can't be bothered.)

  [6.1/10]

## Rothko - A Continual Search For Origins

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/162865,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  The beauty of this album is that everything is so restrained, yet through this restraint everything gets brought to the foreground. A magnificent post-rock album.

  [9.2/10]

## Helm - Axis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4050396776_16.jpg)

  Industrial electronic music. Don't remember much about his last album `Chemical Flowers`, but this one definitely puts him on the map for me. The last track `Tower` sounds like a track out of the OST of some John Carpenter movie. All in all this is a very melodic album.

  [8.3/10]

## Ripatti - Fun Is Not A Straight Line

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0521425493_16.jpg)

  Footwork. I only knew this is actually Vladislav Delay after I checked out the Bandcamp page... Always thought he's an ambient dub techno guy but no idea he's this good at this kind of music. A bunch of rap samples cut up and reassembled, there really is no weak track on this album.

  [8.4/10]

## Madteo - Head Gone Wrong By Noise

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1269595279_16.jpg)

  I don't really know what to make of it... this sounds like the club / jungle music you'd hear on a late night radio station. IIRC his last album is more impressive than this.

  [7.4/10]

## Hanno Leichtmann - Loop Music

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0943744638_16.jpg)

  FFO Mort Garson. Electronic music loops.

  [8.3/10]

## Love Lost But Not Forgotten - Love Lost But Not Forgotten

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1522713369_16.jpg)

  Screamo. Not a huge fan of the high pitched shrieks, but there really aren't a lot of band that still get this kind of raw energy in their records.

  [7.5/10]

## Midori Takada - Through The Looking Glass

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2568768212_16.jpg)

  Exotic ambient / world. It is alright.

  [7.8/10]

## Takuma Watanabe - Last Afternoon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2746983448_16.jpg)

  Really good ambient music.

  [8.2/10]

## HTRK - Rhinestones

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1451820867_16.jpg)

  Minimalistic gothic dream-pop / sadcore. This is Boomkat's AOTY 2021. Sad music for sad people.

  [7.8/10]

## Joyul - Earwitness

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/142844766,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Ambient / dream-pop. There are tracks that are ethereal and also ones that are eerie. A really good debut album.

  [8.3/10]

## Four Tet - Parallel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0041033511_16.jpg)

  The first track is a 26 minutes long ambient track, most of which is pretty good but the last bit with vocal samples kind of makes it a bit goofy. The others are more club friendly house tracks, among them my fav is probably `Parallel 7`.

  [7.7/10]

## Alex Twomey - Days Off

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1743963378_16.jpg)

  Easy listening ambient with post-rock vibes. Feel like the mood on this one is kind of akin to the really over the top, really tiring post-rock big names. Not really that into it...

  [6.6/10]

## Sky H1 - Azure

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0172129100_16.jpg)

  IDM. This one would have been a strong candidate for AOTY 2021 if I caught it when it just came out...

  [8.6/10]

## Burial - Antidawn EP

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3285829469_16.jpg)

  I was really looking forward to this one, but it turns out this is much less memorable than I was expecting.

  [7.4/10]

## Wild Adoration - EP2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3371026163_16.jpg)

  Gothic, minimalistic electro-pop. Looking forward to a longer album!

  [7.8/10]

## Container - Creamer

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3653930742_16.jpg)

  Bombastic techno. IMO it'd be nicer if it had more tracks.

  [8.0/10]

## Koji Nakamura, foodman, Takashi Numazawa - Humanity

  ![](https://cdn2.albumoftheyear.org/500x/album/457707-humanity.jpg)

  Footwork fusion? Dope stuff.

  [8.6/10]

## Charlie Hunter, Lucy Woodward - I'm A Stranger Here

  ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52c456a3e4b07ef824cc498b/1624643789461-4GS6E5MUN8P8N1GDJBHE/Stranger+Final.jpg?format=2500w)

  This one is not as catchy as `Music! Music! Music`.

  [7.4/10]

## Boris - W

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2457243056_16.jpg)

  I didn't really pay much attention to their last couple of releases, but this one I do enjoy quite a bit. It's got grainy lo-fi pop tracks that lead straight into raging doom metal tracks, yet it does not sound out of place. I also like Wata's cooing vocals on this album.

  [8.3/10]

## 黃雨晴 - 化為人形

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/151461949,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Is this a candidate for AOTY 2022? Maybe... Lo-fi pyschedelic bedroom pop.

  [8.8/10]

## 珂拉琪 - MEmento·MORI

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/149014162,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  The production is pretty good but it sounds like your average Japanese pop-heavy punk bands with occasional growls... This is actually the first time I've heard their music, not really sold though.

  [6.6/10]

## Cold Dew - 欲欲

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/140762559,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  I love their live shows, and their album slays as well. Really awesome psych rock.

  [8.3/10]
