## Chris Herbert - Mezzotint

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1383129056_16.jpg)

  Ambient album from Kranky from 2006. Listening to this album I'd imagine the concept of time has ceased to exist, or maybe that's what really good drone music does?

  Cool thing about this album is that Chris Herbert is not a professinal musician: calls himself a non-musician, and all this music is composed of samples and bits retrieved while he's at his day job. Yet this album feels not any less than the works of ambient greats in terms of completeness.

  [8.7/10]

## Helm - Axis

  Industrial electronic music. Don't remember much about his last album `Chemical Flowers`, but this one definitely puts him on the map for me. The last track `Tower` sounds like a track out of the OST of some John Carpenter movie. All in all this is a very melodic album.

  [8.3/10]

## Ripatti - Fun Is Not A Straight Line

  Footwork. I only knew this is actually Vladislav Delay after I checked out the Bandcamp page... Always thought he's an ambient dub techno guy but no idea he's this good at this kind of music. A bunch of rap samples cut up and reassembled, there really is no weak track on this album.

  [8.4/10]

## Madteo - Head Gone Wrong By Noise

  Downtempo /

## Hanno Leichtmann - Loop Music

## Love Lost But Not Forgotten - Love Lost But Not Forgotten

  ![]()

  Screamo. Not a huge fan of the high pitched shrieks, but there really aren't a lot of band that still get this kind of raw energy in their records.

  [7.5/10]

## Midori Takada - Through The Looking Glass

  Exotic ambient / world. It is alright.

  [7.8/10]
