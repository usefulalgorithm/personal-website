## Chris Herbert - Mezzotint

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1383129056_16.jpg)

  Ambient album from Kranky from 2006. Listening to this album I'd imagine the concept of time has ceased to exist, or maybe that's what really good drone music does?

  Cool thing about this album is that Chris Herbert is not a professinal musician: calls himself a non-musician, and all this music is composed of samples and bits retrieved while he's at his day job. Yet this album feels not any less than the works of ambient greats in terms of completeness.

  [8.7/10]

## Various Artists - 滾石40撞樂隊 40團拼經典

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/playlist/global/72234487v2/cropresize/600x600.jpg)

  There are 30 songs in this album but only 5 of them are good... I like Sunset Rollercoaster's cover a lot though, the bassist played his mind out on that track.

  [6.1/10]

## Rothko - A Continual Search For Origins

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/162865,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  The beauty of this album is that everything is so restrained, yet through this restraint everything gets brought to the foreground. A magnificent post-rock album.

  [9.2/10]

## Helm - Axis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4050396776_16.jpg)

  Industrial electronic music. Don't remember much about his last album `Chemical Flowers`, but this one definitely puts him on the map for me. The last track `Tower` sounds like a track out of the OST of some John Carpenter movie. All in all this is a very melodic album.

  [8.3/10]

## Ripatti - Fun Is Not A Straight Line

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0521425493_16.jpg)

  Footwork. I only knew this is actually Vladislav Delay after I checked out the Bandcamp page... Always thought he's an ambient dub techno guy but no idea he's this good at this kind of music. A bunch of rap samples cut up and reassembled, there really is no weak track on this album.

  [8.4/10]

## Madteo - Head Gone Wrong By Noise

## Hanno Leichtmann - Loop Music

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0943744638_16.jpg)

  FFO Mort Garson. Electronic music loops.

  [8.3/10]

## Love Lost But Not Forgotten - Love Lost But Not Forgotten

  ![]()

  Screamo. Not a huge fan of the high pitched shrieks, but there really aren't a lot of band that still get this kind of raw energy in their records.

  [7.5/10]

## Midori Takada - Through The Looking Glass

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2568768212_16.jpg)

  Exotic ambient / world. It is alright.

  [7.8/10]

## Takuma Watanabe - Last Afternoon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2746983448_16.jpg)

  Really good ambient music.

  [8.2/10]

## HTRK - Rhinestones

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1451820867_16.jpg)

  Minimalistic gothic dream-pop / sadcore. This is Boomkat's AOTY 2021. Sad music for sad people.

  [7.8/10]

## Joyul - Earwitness

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/142844766,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Ambient / dream-pop. There are tracks that are ethereal and also ones that are eerie. A really good debut album.

  [8.3/10]
