## Artificial Brain - Artificial Brain

  ![]()

  Fiery tech death. To me I like it better if it's more on the heavier side (cf. Ulcerate), but this is still quite decent metal music.

  [8.0/10]

## Designers - Designers

  ![]()

  Delicate modern jazz music.

  [7.1/10]

## N'Djila Wa Mudujimu - Lady Aicha & Pisko Crane's Original Fulu Miziki of Kinshasa

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1370979743_16.jpg)

  Otherworldly percussive music. This stuff made me headbang at office.

  [8.1/10]

## Benedek - Zebrano

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2598622269_16.jpg)

  Hi-energy disco / dance.

  [7.5/10]

## Maxime Denuc - Nachthorn

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2686757396_16.jpg)

  Dub techno played on organ. This thing is right up my alley...

  [8.5/10]

## Romance, Dean Hurley - In Every Dream Home a Heartache

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0935507890_16.jpg)

  So basically they took a bunch of daytime soap opera footages and made them into David Lynch styled synth drone ambient music. The songs are all very good.

  [8.6/10]

## Amaarae - The Angel You Don't Know

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0749697593_16.jpg)

  Afropop / trap pop / alternative R&B. There's no doubt this is a pop album with absolute banger tracks but there's also a ton of dance / afrobeat references.
  
  [8.2/10]
  
## Ela Minus, DJ Python - ♡

  Balaeric house with dream-pop vocals.

  [7.0/10]

## Fuubutsushi - Birthingbodies

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3375092233_16.jpg)

  Ambient jazz with Patrick Shiroishi playing sax. This feels kind of like Bill Frisell's more soft country tracks for me.

  [7.8/10]

## ssabæ - azurescens

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1896713498_16.jpg)

  Lo-fi modern classical music. FFO Mort Garson.

  [8.8/10]

## Yunzero - Butterfly DNA

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1078917267_16.jpg)

  Dub techno. Dope sounds.

  [8.3/10]

## Caroline Polachek - Welcome to My Island
