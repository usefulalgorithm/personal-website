## 2021 Releases

### Shame - Drunk Tank Pink

  ![]()

  I feel like I've been listening to way too much punk music in January...

  [8.2/10]

### Viagra Boys - Welfare Jazz

  ![]()

  Post-punk + sassy jazz sax. Songs are alright, lyrics sounds kinda meta-ish but that's fine by me.

  [8.1/10]

### R.A.P. Ferreria, Scallops Hotel - Bob's Son

  ![]()

  It's OK

  [7.6/10]

## Non-2021 Releases

### Holly Childs & Gediminas Žygus - Hydrangea

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3255552807_10.jpg)

  Modern composition / spoken word. Very good vaporwave-y music, like something James Ferraro might do.

  [8.7/10]

### Jabu - Sweet Company

  ![]()

  Hypnagogic pop. 喔這很好聽

  [8.4/10]

### Xyla - Ways

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0138336818_10.jpg)

  Techno + IDM + footwork. Ｑ彈電音，讚

  [8.4/10]

### Serpente - Fe / Vazio

  ![]()

  Jungle + IDM. Groovy stuff, 張揚表示不錯聽

  [8.4/10]

### Various Artists - Alterity

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4229211258_10.jpg)

  Gabber / trance techno. The concept surrounding this project is super nerdy almost to the extent of pretentiousness, but the tracks are really fun and stimulating. But then philosophizing = sexy is a long gone fad...

  [8.4/10]

### 青葉市子 - Windswept Adan

  ![]()

  Indie / psychedelic folk. Shifting chord progressions, ethereal vocals and crystalline plucked guitar, what's not to like...

  [8.3/10]

### Michalis Moschoutis - Classical Mechanics

  ![]()

  Modern composition / ambient / field recording. Music to listen to when you're alone

  [8.3/10]

### Hideki Umezawa - Andrew Peklar - Two Views Of Amami Oshima

  ![]()

  Mystical ambient. Love this stuff.

  [8.3/10]

### Various Artists - Virtual Dreams: Ambient Explorations In The House & Techno Age, 1993-1997

  ![]()

  Lots of bangers in this one.

  [8.0/10]

### Jessy Lanza - All The Time

  ![]()

  Retro-pop. Wife seems to like this one a lot.

  [7.8/10]

### Leila - Like Weather

  ![]()

  Downtempo / trip-hop. Sounds good but probably not something I'll revisit in the future.

  [7.9/10]

### Ill Considered - Ill Considered VIII

  ![]()

  Abrasive modern jazz rock.

  [7.7/10]

### Robbie Basho - Selections From Song Of The Avatars: The Lost Master Tapes

  ![]()

  Ragtime.

  [7.7/10]

### Twins - Soon

  ![]()

  Mathy screamo. Like a mathier La Dispute.

  [7.5/10]

### Moor Mother, billy woods - Brass

  ![]()

  This feels more like a billy woods album with cameo appearance from Moor Mother than a collaberation between them. The tracks are alright but not as good as what I expected it to be.

  [7.2/10]

### Omni - Deluxe

  ![]()

  Post-punk revival stuff. Pretty jangly, probably won't revisit it in the future though.

  [6.9/10]
