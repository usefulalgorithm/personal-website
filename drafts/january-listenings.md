## Chris Herbert - Mezzotint

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1383129056_16.jpg)

  Ambient album from Kranky from 2006. Listening to this album I'd imagine the concept of time has ceased to exist, or maybe that's what really good drone music does?

  Cool thing about this album is that Chris Herbert is not a professinal musician: calls himself a non-musician, and all this music is composed of samples and bits retrieved while he's at his day job. Yet this album feels not any less than the works of ambient greats in terms of completeness.

  [8.7/10]
