## Pariah - Caterpillar

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0737896101_16.jpg)

  Upbeat dance techno. Sounds alright, doesn't really click for me.

  [7.2/10]

## Valentina Magaletti - A Queer Anthology of Drums

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2409308596_16.jpg)

  This stuff is pretty good... improvised percussion music. While extremely minimalistic there's still a very strong sense of structure in the songs. It is very avant-garde but not at all hard to follow.

  [8.5/10]

## Cucina Povera, Ben Vince - There I See Everything

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0700565065_16.jpg)

  Calm, sad ambient. This might be my favorite Cucina Povera release yet.

  [8.0/10]

## Sam Gendel - Superstore

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0297013044_16.jpg)

  Humorous modern jazz. This is pretty fun stuff, none of the songs really stand out but it's quite coherent overall.

  [7.5/10]

## Fontaines D.C. - Skinty Fia

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2470443209_16.jpg)

  Not as majestic as `A Hero's Death`.

  [7.1/10]

## Svaneborg Kardyb - Knob

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2499948007_16.jpg)

  Maybe it's just me but I feel like a lot of Nordic jazz bands remind me a lot of Jaga Jazzist... pretty neat jazz music.

  [7.6/10]

## Vladislav Delay, Eivind Aarest - Singles

  ![]()

  Grinding noise that kind of inherits the raw, slow burning energy of Vladislav Delay's `Rakka` series and `Isoviha`, but combined with more ambient elements and at a more galacial pace. I don't dislike it but I find this one a bit lacking in terms of highlights.

  [7.0/10]

## Om Unit - Acid Dub Studies II

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1279450667_16.jpg)

  Gotta love me some quality dub techno that leans much more on the dub side than the techno side.

  [8.2/10]

## Patricia Wolf - See Through

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3705758829_16.jpg)

  Brooding synth ambient. Immersive.

  [8.4/10]

## JID - The Forever Story

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736de37e432e720323f4e31edc)

  Another killer release from JID. Really dig the way he raps.

  [8.4/10]

## Time Wharp - Spiro World

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1971162551_16.jpg)

  It's like Tortoise meets Jaga Jazzist. I dig this.

  [8.3/10]

## 700 Bliss - 700 Bliss

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3614686902_16.jpg)

  Experimental hip-hop. I like Moor Mother a lot but while this is pretty fun to listen to (lots of self referential humor), it does not really have that moving power that's usually present on Moor Mother's albums...

  [7.0/10]
