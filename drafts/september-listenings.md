## Leslie Winer - When I Hit You You'll Feel It

  ![](http://s3.amazonaws.com/quietus_production/images/articles/30277/LITA181-Hi_Res_Cover_1627456350_crop_550x550.jpeg)

  Downtempo / trip-hop. FFO Tricky. An anthology of an artist's work over three decades, and it is very rewarding even if you (like me) don't know anything about her before diving in...

  [8.3/10]

## Yves Tumor - The Asymptotical World EP

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3773942778_16.jpg)

  Gothic pop. Feels like a continuation of the last LP's direction, pretty catchy stuff.

  [7.8/10]

## serpentwithfeet - DEACON

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3741254789_16.jpg)

  Gothic R&B / pop. Not bad, but in my opinion could be a bit more adventurous.

  [7.2/10]

## Pedro Singery - Death For Never

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2395647294_16.jpg)

  Old school new wave (an oxymoron? lol) and rock & roll. Pretty interesting music.

  [7.6/10]

## Anunaku - 042

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1550654355_16.jpg)

  Slick house / club. Feels a bit one dimensional...

  [6.8/10]

## The Bug - Fire

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1432344310_16.jpg)

  Industrial grime.

  [7.5/10]

## Drake - Certified Lover Boy

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736627f8a4e961a92a2fe0d461)

  Certified shitty pop rap.

  [3.3/10]

## The Killers - Pressure Machine

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/60f57fb53707d5ec50b3025b/1:1/w_600/The-Killlers-Pressure-Machine.jpeg)

  Dad rock at its best. They revisit the heartland rock theme, but this time it's more somber and less of a fantastical made-up world like Sam's Town.

  [7.4/10]

## Ojerime - B4 I Breakdown

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2872103853_16.jpg)

  Sounds like gothic pop female singers like Spellling or Nhasa decides to do half crass, half catchy pop songs.

  [7.1/10]

## Lol K - The Breeze

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1316955632_16.jpg)

  Drill / pop. It's not like this is AOTY material but I enjoy this one quite a bit.

  [8.2/10]

## Little Simz - Sometimes I Might Be Introvert

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/60803e1ca9839ab376dedc3e/1:1/w_600/Little-Simz.jpg)

  Some songs are pretty catchy, but overall this sounds much more ingratiating (contrary to the album title...) compared with Grey Area from 2019.

  [6.8/10]

## Arpanet - Inertial Frame

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/746510/large/original.jpeg)

  Cyber-futuristic techno.

  [7.6/10]

## Kilowatthours - The Bright Side

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0683738429_16.jpg)

  Midwestern emo / post-rock. It is way better than I expected...

  [8.2/10]

## 33.10.3402 - Iz Usta

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2672416860_16.jpg)

  Tropical sounding techno / jungle. Chillout vibes.

  [7.5/10]

## 無妄合作社 - No Mercy

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/135310961,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Taiwanese indie rock with faux teenage angsty punkish aesthetics.

  Honesty I was expecting this to be much, much worse than this - I thought it was going to be a clusterfuck of poorly written punk riffs, but actually the execution was rather on point. The problem with this LP is that it's just a bland hodgepodge of pseudo-psych dad rock and midlife crisis post-punk elements. Except for the last track, which is a thrashy, hardcore punk song with squealing guitar solos. I guess this track is meant to be a more lighthearted joke song but to be honest this easily the most memorable track on this LP.

  專輯叫 No Mercy 歌寫得倒是挺討好的

  [5.5/10]

## Smerz - Believer

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3478529554_16.jpg)

  Ghostly gothic indie pop.

  [7.4/10]

## Sofie Birch, Johan - Repair Techniques

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2199339689_16.jpg)

  New-age / ambient.

  [7.8/10]

## John Glacier - SHILOH: Lost For Words

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1456515233_16.jpg)

  Gloomy bedroom trippy hip-hop / hypnagogic rap? Pretty good stuff.

  [7.9/10]

## Tomaga - Intimate Immensity

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2621343013_16.jpg)

  This stuff is hard to categorize to any musical genre... downtempo electro jazz dub with a hint of grime music? Sad that one of them passed away last year, pretty good stuff.

  [7.8/10]

## Facta - Blush

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1132617684_16.jpg)

  I don't think it sounds similar but I guess people who like Pantha Du Prince would like this? Joyous, tingling house music.

  [8.0/10]

## Unrecovery - Look! It Fits Your Size

  ![]()

  Bedroom lo-fi sadcore. I like how the guitars are very grainy and the vocals way out of tune.

  [7.7/10]

## Knifeplay - Pearlty

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3250045804_16.jpg)

  Shoegaze / sadcore. Pretty good indie rock music, but not something that really stands out.

  [7.2/10]

## Dos Monos - Larderello

  ![]()

  The first track is bomb. Overall the previous one has more bangers but this one is still pretty fire.

  [8.2/10]

## A Country Western - Birdfeeder

  ![]()

  It is as if the band Hood released a new album in 2021. I love this sound.

  [8.3/10]

## UMAN - Chaleur Humaine

  ![](https://z9j9e3w7.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Chaleur-Humaine.jpg)

  New-age / world music from 1992.

  [7.8/10]

## Bendik Giske - Cracks

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2473267443_16.jpg)

  Good stuff.

  [8.4/10]

## Low - Hey What

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3711717483_16.jpg)

  I played this through a speaker a bunch of times but wasn't really paying attention to it. Then on the plane back to Taiwan I listened to the album again, this time much less distracted. Initially I wasn't really that into their sound for the last two albums - instead of guitar-heavy slowcore music, they've incorporated more more electronic / noise elements, and I kind of miss the more minimalisitic sound of their older stuff. But on this album the vocals are done meticulously, and blends extremely well with the swirling electronic pads and screechs.

  I like it!

  [8.3/10]

## Devi - Popp

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0455624059_16.jpg)

  World / percussion music. Pretty interesting sound, much more fun than Eli Keszler IMO haha.

  [7.6/10]

## Iceage - Seek Shelter

  ![]()

  Britpop. Overall on the uninspiring side, except for the last track which is pretty dope.

  [6.3/10]

## Lolina - Smoke

  ![]()

  Trippy bedroom indietronica. Or indie-grime / indie-trap? Is that a thing?

  [7.3/10]
