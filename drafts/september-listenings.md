## Grischa Lichtenberger - Works for Last Work

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3307750014_16.jpg)

  Modern composition. I dig this a lot.

  [8.6/10]

## The Body - I Shall Die Here / Earth Triumphant

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1210343578_16.jpg)

  Drone metal / industrial. The first half of this album is basically their identically named album from ~10 years ago remade (or is it just remastered?) The original sound is heavier and more unforgiving whilst this one sounds a lot more refined. Second half is what was going to become a companion album to the aforementioned album, and to me it is a lot more industrial / hip-hop leaning.

  [8.1/10]

## Ὁπλίτης - Ψευδομένη

  Like the other album this one's also pretty good. It's a bit less thrash and a bit more prog though in my opinion.

  [8.0/10]

## Gridlink - Coronet Juniper

  I'd say this is their groove metal album, the riffs are more melodic at the expense of soaring guitar solos. Hopefully they stick around and Takafumi Matsubara is able to stay healthy.

  [7.4/10]
