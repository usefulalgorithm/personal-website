## Grischa Lichtenberger - Works for Last Work

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3307750014_16.jpg)

  Modern composition. I dig this a lot.

  [8.6/10]

## The Body - I Shall Die Here / Earth Triumphant

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1210343578_16.jpg)

  Drone metal / industrial. The first half of this album is basically their identically named album from ~10 years ago remade (or is it just remastered?) The original sound is heavier and more unforgiving whilst this one sounds a lot more refined. Second half is what was going to become a companion album to the aforementioned album, and to me it is a lot more industrial / hip-hop leaning.

  [8.1/10]

## Ὁπλίτης - Ψευδομένη

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0201356871_16.jpg)
  
  Like the other album this one's also pretty good. It's a bit less thrash and a bit more prog though in my opinion.

  [8.0/10]

## Gridlink - Coronet Juniper

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3952026251_16.jpg)

  I'd say this is their groove metal album, the riffs are more melodic at the expense of soaring guitar solos. Hopefully they stick around and Takafumi Matsubara is able to stay healthy.

  [7.4/10]

## Tirzah - trip9love...???

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2540400939_16.jpg)

  Minimalist downtempo pop. People are saying it's somewhat repetitive but I don't think so at all - when the loops are so nice it's not repetitive, it's just pretty good.

  [8.2/10]

## what is your name? - My Name Is...

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2797035787_16.jpg)

  Indie rock / midwest emo.

  [7.0/10]

## Radian - Distorted Rooms

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0593017886_16.jpg)

  Minimal electronic noir-jazz. Love this stuff.

  [8.4/10]

## yeule - softscars

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4141983950_16.jpg)

  Glitch pop / dream pop. While not sounding as distinct / left-field as `Glitch Princess`, this is simply a really good pop album with banger songs.

  [8.6/10]

## Loraine James - Gentle Confrontation

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2879421801_16.jpg)

  IDM / drill and bass. Love the songs on this one.

  [8.2/10]

## Jeff Rosenstock - HELLMODE

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0462955102_16.jpg)

  Probably one of the best pop punk albums I've heard in a long time.

  [8.0/10]

## Haunter - Please Understand

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0638916160_16.jpg)

  Droning shoegaze music. Some songs have riffs that had me think of the nu metal drop D riffs.

  [7.3/10]

## Croatian Amor - A Part of You in Everything

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2104959669_16.jpg)

  Ambient techno. It's OK I guess...

  [6.8/10]

## Nerves Baddington - No Survivor

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2994653313_16.jpg)

  Drum and bass / industrial hip-hop. Pretty grim sounding.

  [7.2/10]

## Armand Hammer - We Buy Diabetic Test Strips

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1265013984_16.jpg)

  Abstract conscious hip-hop. The lyrics on this album is, like, really out there...

  [8.8/10]

## Laurel Halo - Atlas

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2169093004_16.jpg)

  Impressionist neo-classical / ambient jazz. Postmodern Joe Hisashi is what came to mind. Love virtually every track on this album.

  [9.0/10]
