## Pariah - Caterpillar

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0737896101_16.jpg)

  Upbeat dance techno. Sounds alright, doesn't really click for me.

  [7.2/10]

## Valentina Magaletti - A Queer Anthology of Drums

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2409308596_16.jpg)

  This stuff is pretty good... improvised percussion music. While extremely minimalistic there's still a very strong sense of structure in the songs. It is very avant-garde but not at all hard to follow.

  [8.5/10]
