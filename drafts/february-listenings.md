## 2021 Releases

### Exael - Flowered Knife Shadows

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1858629917_10.jpg)

  Acid techno / breakbeat music made on a half broken laptop. This is something you could put on repeat and every spin will be equally rewarding.

  [8.4/10]

### Tassos Chalkias - Divine Reeds

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1629176144_16.jpg)

  Greek psych folk. I like this a lot.

  [8.1/10]

### Yu Su - Yellow River Blue

  ![]()

  Techno / jungle. I don't like the pentatonic sequence in the first song, but the other tracks are pretty dope.

  [7.8/10]

### Emptyness - Vide

  ![]()

  Post-post-post-post-post-post-post black metal.

  [7.0/10]

### Atom TM - 0.9

  ![]()

  Industrial techno. The human voices on this record come off as a little goofy to me...

  [6.8/10]

### Liquid Son - Garden Of Eden

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3695451375_10.jpg)

  Ancient techno that sounds like eurodance to me. Never a fan of that type of music.

  [6.3/10]

### Weezer - OK Human

  ![]()

  River Cuomo does Disney songs. Disney songs are never that bad, the problem with them has always been their corniness...

  [5.8/10]

### Mogwai - As The Love Continues

  ![]()

  This is wack.

  [4.0/10]

## 2020 Releases

  Don't sleep on this guy...

  [8.5/10]

### Various Artists - Sharpen, Moving

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2163956216_10.jpg)

  Jungle / dub / techno compilation from Bristol label Timedance. Wobbly stuff, like this a lot.

  [8.1/10]

### Bonnie Prince Billy - I Made A Place

  ![]()

  Comforting folk songs.

  [8.0/10]

### Voldy Moyo - Liberty City

  [7.5/10]

### Raspberry Bulbs - Before The Age Of Mirrors

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4279676239_16.jpg)

  Raw punk. Think a even more noisy Pissed Jeans. Don't really see anything that's black metal in this record though...

  [7.0/10]

## 2018 Releases

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2459101898_10.jpg)
