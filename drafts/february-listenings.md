## James Rushford - Lake from the Louvers

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2307018495_16.jpg)

  Ambient / field recording. Haunting soudnscape.

  [7.8/10]

## Nobukazu Takemura - Child and Magic

  ![](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/770x0/28bbd733c80c40a9b879d9c7eef03569.jpg)

  Magnificent Japanese experimental music. It is new-age, it is post-classical, it is muffled drum & bass, it is noisy techno, it is... very hard to say what this is. A hidden gem that deserves much more recognition.

  [9.0/10]

## tricot - 上出来

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/146945363,1v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Never a big fan of them... it's got chops but it really isn't that good.

  [6.4/10]

## Comets On Fire - Field Recordings from the Sun

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0277059141_16.jpg)

  Lo-fi stoner metal. I've always remembered them as a psych rock band that leans on the less heavier side of the spectrum, but this one is as hard hitting as it gets.

  [7.7/10]

## Berk Icli - Glimpses of an Eternal Bloom

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3066053426_16.jpg)

  Ethereal, melodic modern classical / chamber music. Lots of fun.

  [7.7/10]

## Cities Aviv - Man Plays The Horn

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0563050005_16.jpg)

  I like this just as much as I like his last year's album, `The Crashing Sound of How It Goes`.

  [8.4/10]

## DJ Python - Club Sentimientos Vol. 2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1257468602_16.jpg)

  This is much tamer than his 2020 masterpiece, `Mas Amable`.

  [7.3/10]

## yeule - Glitch Princess

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2971522590_16.jpg)

  Post-apocalyptic pop. Way better than Poppy, way better than GFOTY, way better than those two combined.

  [8.1/10]

## Celeste - Assassine(s)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2298190935_16.jpg)

  This is probably my favorite release of theirs. I've always felt their stuff is a bit one dimensional, but this one incorporates more screamo elements, which I dig.

  [8.4/10]

## Emma Ruth Rundle - Some Heavy Ocean

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3964655753_16.jpg)

  I didn't know she's in Red Sparrowes, and I never really paid attention to Marriage, but maybe I should... I like the song `Run Forever` a lot, but overall these songs gets a bit tiring after a while.

  [7.4/10]

## Piotr Kurek - World Speaks

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2405479523_16.jpg)

  Chamber music / minimal modern classical. Unsettling and thoroughly awesome.

  [8.5/10]

## Shinichi Atobe - Love of Plastic

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/786227/large/unnamed-6-3.jpg)

  This feels a lot weaker than the more minimalist albums from before. Never really a big fan of balearic house...

  [6.7/10]

## Bloodmoney Perez, Messiah Musik - Second Hand Accounts

  ![]()

  Dope conscious rap.

  [8.3/10]

## Undo K From Hot - G.A.S. Get A Star

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2566969169_16.jpg)

  Erractic industrial experimental rock. A bit too much for me.

  [7.2/10]

## Debit - The Long Count

  ![]()

  []

## Mark Lanegan - Blues Funeral

  ![]()

  Bluesy indie rock. RIP Mark Lanegan.

  [8.1/10]

## Nueen - Circular Sequence

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4072282675_16.jpg)

  Minimalistic electronica. I like this a lot, whoever that likes Ulla would love this too.

  [8.6/10]

## Earthless - Night Parade of One Hundred Demons

  ![]()

  I like the track `Death To The Red Sun`, but others have too much Japanese scale runs in them, and it sounds kind of silly...

  [7.4/10]

## Francesco Cavaliere - Xylomania

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1705323302_16.jpg)

  Abstract modern composition / ambient. Tingling sounds, listened through it a bunch of times before finally deciding that I am digging this quite a bit.

  [8.2/10]

## Orphx, Kareem - As Your Skies Are Fading Away

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1502214096_16.jpg)

  Industrial techno. Kareem's `Zones of Significance` was one of my favorite albums from 2021. This one is more techno and less ambient / experimental than that one.

  [7.8/10]
