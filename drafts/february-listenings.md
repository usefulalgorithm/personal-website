## Meitei - Shiturai

  ![]()

  Soothing but somewhat unmemorable ambient piano music. Hope he does another full-length album sooner than later...

  [6.5/10]

## Big Thief - Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You

  Alternative country music. I love Adrianne Lenker but somehow Big Thief has always evaded me, or maybe it is the other way around.

  [8.3/10]

## David Edren, H. Takahashi - Flow

  Shimmery ambient. This is exactly the kind of music I enjoy.

  [8.2/10]
