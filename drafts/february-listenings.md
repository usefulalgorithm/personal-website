## James Rushford - Lake from the Louvers

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2307018495_16.jpg)

  Ambient / field recording. Haunting soudnscape.

  [7.8/10]

## Nobukazu Takemura - Child and Magic

  Magnificent Japanese experimental music. It is new-age, it is post-classical, it is muffled drum & bass, it is noisy techno, it is... very hard to say what this is. A hidden gem that deserves much more recognition.

  [9.0/10]

## tricot - 上出来

  Never a big fan of them... it's got chops but it really isn't that good.

  [6.4/10]

## Comets On Fire - Field Recordings from the Sun

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0277059141_16.jpg)

  Lo-fi stoner metal. I've always remembered them as a psych rock band that leans on the less heavier side of the spectrum, but this one is as hard hitting as it gets.

  [7.7/10]

## Berk Icli - Glimpses of an Eternal Bloom

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3066053426_16.jpg)

  Ethereal, melodic modern classical / chamber music. Lots of fun.

  [7.7/10]

## Cities Aviv - Man Plays The Horn

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0563050005_16.jpg)

  I like this just as much as I like his last year's album, `The Crashing Sound of How It Goes`.

  [8.4/10]

## DJ Python - Club Sentimientos Vol. 2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1257468602_16.jpg)

  This is much tamer than his 2020 masterpiece, `Mas Amable`.

  [7.3/10]

## yeule - Glitch Princess

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2971522590_16.jpg)

  Post-apocalyptic pop. Way better than Poppy, way better than GFOTY, way better than those two combined.

  [8.1/10]

## Celeste - Assassine(s)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2298190935_16.jpg)

  This is probably my favorite release of theirs. I've always felt their stuff is a bit one dimensional, but this one incorporates more screamo elements, which I dig.

  [8.4/10]

## Emma Ruth Rundle - Some Heavy Ocean

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3964655753_16.jpg)

  [7.6/10]
