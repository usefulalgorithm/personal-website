## Portrayal of Guilt - Devil Music

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3830043412_16.jpg)

  It's as meh as it can be. The last chamber music suite is just... strange in a bad way.

  [4.8/10]

## Christoph De Babalon - Leaving Time

  ![]()

  This is tamer than his last several releases.

  [7.3/10]

## Black Math Horseman - Black Math Horseman

  ![]()

  I wasn't expecting this to be more metal than doom... it's pretty good, hopefully they keep it going and tour a bit. I'd definitely go see.

  [7.5/10]

## billy woods, Kenny Segal - Maps

  ![]()

  Another banger from these two.

  [8.1/10]

## CS + Kreme - Orange

  ![]()

  [7.3/10]

## Earth - Even Hell has its Heroes (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)

  ![]()

  Earth is one of those super rare bands whose discography is so consistently awesome.

  [8.1/10]

## 100 gecs - 10,000 gecs

  ![]()

  Why this can be so corny yet so much fun at the same time is beyond me...

  [7.9/10]

## Kassem Mosse - Workshop 32

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2290018590_16.jpg)

  I think abstract house is probably the right term to describe this one. It's pretty good.

  [7.8/10]

## Caroline Polachek - Desire, I Want To Turn Into You

  ![]()

  Pop. I still don't get why people are so into her... to me it's quite mediocre.

  [5.5/10]

## Hauschka, Hildur Guonadottir - Pan Tone

  ![]()

  Modern classical.

  []

## Flume - Things Don't Always Go The Way You Plan

  ![]()

  []

## Midwife, Vyva Melinkolya - Orbweaving

  ![]()

  Sadcore.

  [8.5/10]

## Ecka Mordecai - Promise & Illusion

  ![]()

  []

## Rina Sawayama - Hold The Girl

  ![]()

  This is probably her most accessible album to date.

  [8.1/10]
