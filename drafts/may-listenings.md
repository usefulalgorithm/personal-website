## Susumu Yokota - Symbol

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1699237270_16.jpg)

  Techno filled with classical samples. It's probably the most observably playful album I've heard from him.

  [8.0/10]

## Dean Hurley - Concrete Feather

  Desolate ambient field recording. Somehow sounds like something that could be the soundtrack to Factorio...

  [8.2/10]
