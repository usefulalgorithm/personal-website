## Susumu Yokota - Symbol

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1699237270_16.jpg)

  Techno filled with classical samples. It's probably the most observably playful album I've heard from him.

  [8.4/10]

## Dean Hurley - Concrete Feather

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1160724861_16.jpg)

  Desolate ambient field recording. Somehow sounds like something that could be the soundtrack to Factorio...

  [7.8/10]

## Alabaster DePlume - GOLD

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2964482710_16.jpg)

  Smoky noir-jazz / spiritual jazz.

  [7.6/10]

## Astrid Sonne - outside of your lifetime

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2960452016_16.jpg)

  Really awesome electronic music. Beautiful sounds.

  [8.5/10]

## Organ Tapes - 唱着那无人问津的歌谣

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0064537726_16.jpg)

  Didn't really understand his last album, which my friends all seem to love so much, but this one I totally get. Bedroom pop that feels genuine and deeply emotional.

  [8.3/10]

## Drum & Lace - Natura

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0527733418_16.jpg)

  Ethereal IDM. Pretty cool.

  [7.8/10]

## Fennesz - Hotel Paral.lel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0965009029_16.jpg)

  Somehow this kind of feels like where OPN's first album sits in his discography: probably the darkest and dissonant of the entire line, but still kind of hints at what's to come in the future. Anyways I can't seriously imagine someone would not like this...

  [8.4/10]

## billy woods - History Will Absolve Me

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3883781247_16.jpg)

  Sound-wise this is more boom-bap than the kind of stuff he does right now. Lyrics-wise I'd say billy woods is consistently on a level of his own... or on a level that most rappers would not even be able to comprehend.

  [8.5/10]

## Kilo Kish - American Gurl

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273814ff2f53547f2930b7cb7f6)

  FFO Charli XCX and Rina Sawayama's self-titled EP. Futuristic electro-pop... the not annoying kind.

  [8.2/10]

## Minoru Fushimi - Thanatos of Funk

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2262826227_16.jpg)

  Psych-funk / proto-hip-hop from Japan. A rare gem.

  [7.4/10]

## Gospel - The Loser

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1281987747_16.jpg)

  Why do almost all rock bands I like all decided to do dad rock... Innovative progressive screamo band turns stale.

  [5.0/10]

## claire rousay - everything perfect is already here

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3632847398_16.jpg)

  Soothing ambient / field recording. Dig it.

  [8.1/10]

## Ilia Belorukov - Someone Has Always Come

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3575182657_16.jpg)

  Drone music for haunted brutalist ruins.

  [7.7/10]

## Kendrick Lamar - Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/172948165,1v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  No one:
  
  Absolutely no one:

  Me: To Pimp a Butterfly > Good Kid, M.A.A.D City >> Mr. Morale & The Big Stepers > DAMN.

  [7.4/10]

## Pataphysical - Hapticality

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4249288100_16.jpg)

  Synth heavy ambient / experimental electronic music. FFO Space Afrika & KMRU I guess?

  [8.6/10]

## Gabber Modus Operandi - PUXXXIMAXXX

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3823147522_16.jpg)

  Gamelan + hardcore techno. Pretty intense.

  [7.3/10]

## Conway the Machine - God Don't Make Mistakes

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273130fad2aec1c9c9763968d97)

  This is more impressive than his last LP. Decent conscious hip-hop.

  [8.0/10]

## Black Country, New Road - Ants From Up There

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3874459819_16.jpg)

  Emo / post-punk / chamber pop. Feels much more approachable than their last one... don't hate it but I guess I like Modest Mouse more?

  [7.0/10]

## Jonny Nash, Ana Stamp - There Up, Behind the Moon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2456182175_16.jpg)

  Mystical Romanian folk songs + lo-fi solo Joe Hisashi-ish piano (well not really).

  [7.4/10]

## Lee Gamble - A Million Pieces of You

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1675491030_16.jpg)

  Deconstructed club music is probably the best way to describe this. Dope stuff.

  [8.2/10]
