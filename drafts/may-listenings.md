## Portrayal of Guilt - Devil Music

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3830043412_16.jpg)

  It's as meh as it can be. The last chamber music suite is just... strange in a bad way.

  [4.8/10]

## Christoph De Babalon - Leaving Time

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2247282394_16.jpg)

  This is tamer than his last several releases.

  [7.3/10]

## Black Math Horseman - Black Math Horseman

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0222242523_10.jpg)

  I wasn't expecting this to be more metal than doom... it's pretty good, hopefully they keep it going and tour a bit. I'd definitely go see.

  [7.5/10]

## billy woods, Kenny Segal - Maps

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2712863742_16.jpg)

  Another banger from these two.

  [8.1/10]

## Earth - Even Hell has its Heroes (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2967642796_10.jpg)

  Earth is one of those super rare bands whose discography is so consistently awesome.

  [8.0/10]

## 100 gecs - 10000 gecs

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b27323c7a7224c1378fc3e6427cb)

  Why this can be so corny yet so much fun at the same time is beyond me...

  [7.9/10]

## Kassem Mosse - Workshop 32

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2290018590_16.jpg)

  I think abstract house is probably the right term to describe this one. It's pretty good.

  [7.8/10]

## Caroline Polachek - Desire, I Want To Turn Into You

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/224875706,1v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Pop. I still don't get why people are so into her... to me it's quite mediocre.

  [5.5/10]

## Midwife, Vyva Melinkolya - Orbweaving

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1381864395_16.jpg)

  Sadcore. I still think their best album is `Forever`, but this is also quite nice.

  [8.3/10]

## Rina Sawayama - Hold The Girl

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273104771507d9c63da11abb6dc)

  This is probably her most accessible album to date.

  [7.8/10]

## The Space Lady - The Space Lady's Greatest Hits

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1237549209_10.jpg)

  Cosmic psychedelic outsider pop. To call this "outsider music" does not really do it justice, it's like calling off Stereolab as alt-rock and just leave it at that. The lady's story behind her oeuvre is also very fascinating.

  [8.3/10]

## Colorlist - Full Circle

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0970750950_16.jpg)

  Modern jazz / electronic. FFO of Tortoise. I enjoy this very much. The track `Kink in the Line` has some really sick drums.

  [8.3/10]

## Richard Skelton - selenodesy

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2597056397_16.jpg)

  It's kind of like GAS's more orchestral moments with Ben Frost-esque ambience. Dope stuff.

  [8.5/10]

## CS + Kreme - Orange

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0373672906_16.jpg)

  Jazz-noir + techno. I thought I didn't like it when I listened to it numerous times absentmindedly at work, but when I really did listen to it it's actually a banger.

  [8.0/10]

## Hauschka, Hildur Guonadottir - Pan Tone

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0018996632_16.jpg)

  Modern classical / chamber post-rock.

  [7.1/10]

## Marissa Nadler - The Path of the Clouds

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3156985101_16.jpg)

  Dream-pop + gothic country... Dream-country?

  [8.2/10]

## mudy on the 昨晚 - An Instrumental

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4266911963_16.jpg)

  My favorite Japanese math rock released a new album after a hiatus of who knows how long. The louder songs still kick a lot of ass.

  [7.8/10]

## Ital Tek - Timeproof

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0286948287_16.jpg)

  Introspective, dark techno music. I like it.

  [8.2/10]

## Celestaphone - Paper Cut From the Obit

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0345290599_16.jpg)

  Insanely good cut-up abstract jazz rap.

  [8.8/10]

## Flume - Things Don't Always Go The Way You Plan

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0795925567_16.jpg)

  Hyperpop. I actually don't dislike it, but it's not one of those spectacular albums that I'd go back to from time to time. People are criticizing it for being inconsistent, but I find it to be miles ahead of a bunch of K-pop and contemporary Taiwanese pop albums in terms of overall production quality. Maybe it's all a matter of comparison? But then it does pale in comparison to `Arrived Anxious, Left Bored`.

  [7.0/10]

## Blind Girls - Residue

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2212622391_16.jpg)

  Violent screamo record. Quick and on point.

  [8.1/10]
