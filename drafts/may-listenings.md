## Portrayal of Guilt - Devil Music

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3830043412_16.jpg)

  It's as meh as it can be. The last chamber music suite is just... strange in a bad way.

  [6.3/10]

## Christoph De Babalon - Leaving Time

  ![]()

  This is tamer than his last several releases.

  [7.5/10]

## Black Math Horseman - Black Math Horseman

  ![]()

  I wasn't expecting this to be more metal than doom... it's pretty good, hopefully they keep it going and tour a bit. I'd definitely go see.

  [7.8/10]

## billy woods, Kenny Segal - Maps

  ![]()

  They're back at it.

  [8.1/10]

## CS + Kreme - Orange

  ![]()

  [7.3/10]

## Earth - Even Hell has its Heroes (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)

  ![]()

  Earth is one of those super rare bands whose discography is so consistently awesome.

  [8.2/10]

## 100 gecs - 10,000 gecs

  ![]()

  Why this can be so corny yet so much fun is beyond me...

  [8.0/10]

## Kassem Mosse - Workshop 32

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2290018590_16.jpg)

  I think abstract house is the best term to describe this one.

  [8.1/10]

## Caroline Polachek - Desire, I Want To Turn Into You
