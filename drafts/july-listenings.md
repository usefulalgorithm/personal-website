## Felicia Atkinson - Image Language

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2056346138_16.jpg)

  Stellar soothing ambient. Great as always.

  [8.4/10]

## Caterina Barbieri - Spirit Exit

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0860446015_16.jpg)

  This one features more singing than `Exstatic Computation`, so in a sense it is even more pop? It is pretty good though.

  [8.2/10]

## more eaze, claire rousay - Never Stop Texting Me

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4055169876_16.jpg)

  This is like if people never known for doing pop music but listen to a lot of it start doing it all of a sudden. Pop music that seems normal everywhere you check but still feels somewhat uncanny...

  [7.4/10]

## cktrl - zero

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2921109596_16.jpg)

  Jazzy R&B / pop trap. I like the first and second tracks, but I feel like as the album goes on it gets increasingly influenced by pop trap music...

  [7.0/10]

## Kelly Lee Owens - LP.8

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1210404852_16.jpg)

  I've listened to this album a bunch of times but it just does not click... this is her most ambient-ish album to date, and I guess making the comparison to the genre's giants is unfair but I would pick Laurel Halo over this any day of the week.

  [6.8/10]

## Jenny Hval - Classic Objects

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273653563da2516c1edf706398c)

  In terms of songwriting this feels like one of her most accessible albums to date. Not saying it's bad, but I actually expect a bit more experimentation from this project. Lyrics wise this feels more introspective, but I really haven't spend that much time figuring out what she's singing on this album. Maybe I should revisit this one in the future...

  [8.0/10]

## Thou, Mizmor - Myopia

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2341892032_16.jpg)

  Really heavy doom metal. I am a sucker for anything Thou does.

  [8.1/10]

## Cate Le Bon - Pompeii

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2013004350_16.jpg)

  Post-punk-ish art pop. Pretty good stuff...

  [8.2/10]

## Zola Jesus - Arkhon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3275404382_16.jpg)

  I've always felt Zola Jesus' music, although mainly known as a darkwave gothic project, has that hidden (or probably not hidden just ignored) pop sensibility. Here that pop influence takes the front stage.

  [7.3/10]

## Gospel - MVDM: The Magical Volumes Vol. 1: The Magick Volume of Dark Madder or the Magic Volume of Dark Matter

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4256822995_16.jpg)

  Better than their full-length this year, still a far cry from `The Moon is a Dead World`.

  [6.5/10]

## Wormrot - Hiss

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1129311430_16.jpg)

  This shit slaps. Every single track is killer.

  [8.8/10]

## Rolo Tomassi - Where Myth Becomes Mystery

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0047102255_16.jpg)

  At first I thought this is what 珂拉琪 would sound like 10 years from now, but the more I listen to this one the worse it sounds...

  [4.4/10]

## black midi - Hellfire

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1041686626_16.jpg)

  Though this is called `Hellfire` it feels more accessible than their previous album, which I like very much and prefer compared to this new album. This thing definitely is a fun album in its own way though. 

  [7.7/10]

## To Be Gentle - Love is the Only Way Out

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3506143986_10.jpg)

  OK screamo / hardcore.

  [6.8/10]

## Scarcity - Aveilut

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0924203936_16.jpg)

  It sounds like Russian Circles (in their current, more atmospheric form rather than the mathier sound they're known before) decides to do black metal. This is pretty good.

  [8.0/10]

## Slow Fire Pistol - Rabbit Town Blues

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0025277380_16.jpg)

  Screamo. It's alright, but not the most memorable thing ever. They got plenty of coverage on the internet, which is always a nice thing to have for lesser known bands.

  [7.3/10]

## Vladislav Delay - Isoviha

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0644915806_16.jpg)

  This is quite gnarly.

  [8.1/10]

## Panopticon - Collapse

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2133139007_16.jpg)

  His second full-length album just got remastered. Songs on this album feel less polished or consistent than his later works, but this is still pretty good black metal nonetheless.

  [7.4/10]

## Pavel Milyakov, Richie Culver - A Change of Nothing

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/821190/large/996d52ca-720d-a65f-7b8a-86c87abe8149.jpg)

  Visceral, abrasive ambient / electronic music. Hard-hitting.

  [8.4/10]

## Imperial Triumphant - Spirit of Ecstasy

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2737367339728fdf696ab732b45)

  I feel like this one is more accessible than any of their previous albums: it even has friggin' Kenny G on `Merkurius Gilded`... the jazz influence is much more prevalent on this album. Dig it.

  [8.0/10]

## Racine - Amities

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2877761617_16.jpg)

  Post-industrial piano music. Very haunting music, I've been listening to this album for days...

  [8.5/10]

## Chat Pile - God's Country

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2068121131_16.jpg)

  OMG, the hype is really real...

  [8.9/10]
