## Perila - How Much Time It Is Between You And Me?

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3669737048_16.jpg)

  Museum music. More specifically, the soundtrack to a documentary piece you see in the art museum, the piece being about some extremely slow movements, viewed from infinitely many perspectives. Chilling music.

  [8.2/10]

## Eli Keszler - Icons

  ![]()

  Dark jazz. While this album is more structured in terms of songwriting, it is much less exciting compared to his previous album.

  [7.0/10]

## Tyler, The Creator - Call Me If You Get Lost

  ![]()

  Overall this is a pretty solid album. I like the tracks that have elevator music-ish instrumentals the best. Haven't really listened to Igor so don't know how this one holds up against it though.

  [8.1/10]

## Turinn - 18 1/2 Minute Gaps

  Mystical techno. Sounds like Burial meets JK Flesh.

  [8.3/10]

## Pom Poko - Cheater

  ![]()

  Art rock / post-punk. Angular guitar tones and hyper energetic vocals. I found this band after I watch the movie Pom Poko, sick anime movie...

  [7.2/10]

## WasWaas - Antidote

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2204443499_10.jpg)

  Minimal techno / ambient. I like every track on this EP.

  [8.4/10]

## Ann Margaret Hogan - Funeral Cargo

  ![]()

  Modern classical. Richard Clayderman does soundtrack for Red Dead Redemption.

  [6.3/10]

## Ambrose Akinmusire - On The Tender Spot Of Every Calloused Moment

  ![]()

  Modern jazz music. I appreciate the more chaotic, more free-jazz-ish tracks like Tide of Hyacinth than the other ones.

  [7.5/10]

## Pan Daijing - Jade

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3732120509_16.jpg)

  I find this to be more easily approachable than 2017's Lack. Gothic experimental opera music?

  [8.2/10]

## Tangents - Stateless

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0223797556_16.jpg)

  Jazz / IDM. Kinda reminds me of Tortoise's stuff, although they're actually completely different...

  [8.1/10]

## Yoshinori Hayashi - Pulse Of Defiance

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2335361099_16.jpg)

  Techno. Pretty diverse album in terms of musical style and texture, or you could say it kind of lacks focus, which is sort of how I feel about this album.

  [7.0/10]

## Moin - Moot!

  ![]()
  
  Math rock. I am not a huge fan of the drums on this album - it could have been done in a much more subtle way. Now it's way too full and kind of distracting.

  [6.8/10]

## Suzanne Kraft - About You

  ![]()

  Dream pop. Feels kinda generic...

  [6.5/10]

## Malcolm Pardon - Hello Death

  ![]()

  Somber keyboard music. I know they're very different, but I kind of feel like this and Masayoshi Fujita's Apologue both have the same solemn, nostalgic mood going on. Good stuff.

  [8.4/10]

## Midwife - Luminol

  ![]()

  Best sadcore album I've heard this year. Even wife thinks this is pretty good music.

  [8.8/10]

## Lilla - Soundness Of Mind

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1792213513_16.jpg)

  Meditative new-age electronic music. These two dudes met in a Zen monastary... Very oriental sounding at times.

  [7.6/10]

## Hightide Hotel - Naturally

  ![]()

  I am too old for punk rock. I prefer Nothing Was Missing, Except Me to this one.

  [6.7/10]

## Satomimagae - Hanazono

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3270919930_16.jpg)

  Ambient / indie-folk. Very reverb heavy, kind of reminds me of Julianna Barwick (well kind of...)

  [7.8/10]
