## Felicia Atkinson - Image Language

  ![]()

  Stellar soothing ambient. Great as always.

  [8.4/10]

## Caterina Barbieri - Spirit Exit

  This one features more singing than `Exstatic Computation`, so in a sense it is even more pop? It is pretty good though.

  [8.2/10]

## more eaze, claire rousay - Never Stop Texting Me

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4055169876_16.jpg)

  This is like if people never known for doing pop music but listen to a lot of it start doing it all of a sudden. Pop music that seems normal everywhere you check but still feels somewhat uncanny...

  [7.4/10]

## cktrl - zero

  Jazzy R&B / pop trap. I like the first and second tracks, but I feel like as the album goes on it gets increasingly influenced by pop trap music...

  [7.0/10]

## Destroyer - LABYRINTHITIS

## Kelly Lee Owens - LP.8

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1210404852_16.jpg)

  I've listened to this album a bunch of times but it just does not click... this is her most ambient-ish album to date, and I guess making the comparison to the genre's giants is unfair but I would pick Laurel Halo over this any day of the week.

  [6.8/10]

## Jenny Hval - Classic Objects

  ![]()

  In terms of songwriting this feels like one of her most accessible albums to date. Not saying it's bad, but I actually expect a bit more experimentation from this project. Lyrics wise this feels more introspective, but I really haven't spend that much time figuring out what she's singing on this album. Maybe I should revisit this one in the future...

  [8.0/10]

## Thou, Mizmor - Myopia

  ![]()

  Really heavy doom metal. I am a sucker for anything Thou does.

  [8.1/10]

## Cate Le Bon - Pompeii

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2013004350_16.jpg)

  Post-punk-ish art pop. Pretty good stuff...

  [8.2/10]

## Zola Jesus - Arkhon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3275404382_16.jpg)

  I've always felt Zola Jesus' music, although mainly known as a darkwave gothic project, has that hidden (or probably not hidden just ignored) pop sensibility. Here that pop influence takes the front stage.

  [7.3/10]

## Gospel - MVDM: The Magical Volumes Vol. 1: The Magick Volume of Dark Madder or the Magic Volume of Dark Matter

  ![]()

  Better than their full-length this year, still a far cry from `The Moon is a Dead World`.

  [6.5/10]

## Wormrot - Hiss

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1129311430_16.jpg)

  This shit slaps. Every single track is killer.

  [8.8/10]

## Rolo Tomassi - Where Myth Becomes Mystery

  ![]()

  At first I thought this is what 珂拉琪 would sound like 10 years from now, but the more I listen to this one the worse it sounds...

  [4.4/10]

## black midi - Hellfire

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1041686626_16.jpg)

  Though this is called `Hellfire` it feels more accessible than their previous album, which I like very much and prefer compared to this new album. This thing definitely is a fun album in its own way though. 

  [7.7/10]
