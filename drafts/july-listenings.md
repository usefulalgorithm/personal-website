## Perila - How Much Time It Is Between You And Me?

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3669737048_16.jpg)

  Museum music. More specifically, the soundtrack to a documentary piece you see in the art museum, the piece being about some extremely slow movements, viewed from infinitely many perspectives. Chilling music.

  [8.3/10]

## Eli Keszler - Icons

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3678044419_10.jpg)

  Dark jazz. While this album is more structured in terms of songwriting, it is much less exciting compared to his previous album.

  [7.0/10]

## Tyler, The Creator - Call Me If You Get Lost

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/124778204,3v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Overall this is a pretty solid album. I like the tracks that have elevator music-ish instrumentals the best. Haven't really listened to Igor so don't know how this one holds up against it though.

  [8.2/10]

## Turinn - 18 1/2 Minute Gaps

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/405698/large/Cover.jpg)

  Mystical techno. Sounds like Burial meets JK Flesh.

  [8.3/10]

## Pom Poko - Cheater

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0238049638_16.jpg)

  Art rock / post-punk. Angular guitar tones and hyper energetic vocals. I found this band after I watch the movie Pom Poko, sick anime movie...

  [7.2/10]

## WasWaas - Antidote

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2204443499_10.jpg)

  Minimal techno / ambient. I like every track on this EP.

  [8.4/10]

## Ann Margaret Hogan - Funeral Cargo

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2846855686_16.jpg)

  Modern classical. Richard Clayderman does soundtrack for Red Dead Redemption.

  [6.3/10]

## Ambrose Akinmusire - On The Tender Spot Of Every Calloused Moment

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ee90263ca5f171c3b76ffb5/1:1/w_600/on%20the%20tender%20spot%20of%20every%20calloused%20moment%20_Ambrose%20Akinmusire.jpg)

  Modern jazz music. I appreciate the more chaotic, more free-jazz-ish tracks like Tide of Hyacinth than the other ones.

  [7.5/10]

## Pan Daijing - Jade

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3732120509_16.jpg)

  I find this to be more easily approachable than 2017's Lack. Gothic experimental opera music?

  [8.2/10]

## Tangents - Stateless

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0223797556_16.jpg)

  Jazz / IDM. Kinda reminds me of Tortoise's stuff, although they're actually completely different...

  [8.1/10]

## Yoshinori Hayashi - Pulse Of Defiance

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2335361099_16.jpg)

  Techno. Pretty diverse album in terms of musical style and texture, or you could say it kind of lacks focus, which is sort of how I feel about this album.

  [7.0/10]

## Moin - Moot!

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4103439597_16.jpg)

  Math rock. I am not a huge fan of the drums on this album - it could have been done in a much more subtle way. Now it's way too full and kind of distracting.

  [6.8/10]

## Suzanne Kraft - About You

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2969444058_10.jpg)

  Dream pop. Feels kinda generic...

  [6.5/10]

## Malcolm Pardon - Hello Death

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4046920205_16.jpg)

  Somber keyboard music. I know they're very different, but I kind of feel like this and Masayoshi Fujita's Apologue both have the same solemn, nostalgic mood going on. Good stuff.

  [8.4/10]

## Midwife - Luminol

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4007135572_16.jpg)

  Best sadcore album I've heard this year. Even wife thinks this is pretty good music.

  [8.8/10]

## Lilla - Soundness Of Mind

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1792213513_16.jpg)

  Meditative new-age electronic music. These two dudes met in a Zen monastary... Very oriental sounding at times.

  [7.6/10]

## Hightide Hotel - Naturally

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1532803658_16.jpg)

  I am too old for punk rock. I prefer Nothing Was Missing, Except Me to this one.

  [6.3/10]

## Satomimagae - Hanazono

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3270919930_16.jpg)

  Ambient / indie-folk. Very reverb heavy, kind of reminds me of Julianna Barwick (well kind of...)

  [7.8/10]

## Year Of No Light - Consolamentum

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2057740124_16.jpg)

  It's either this album simply isn't that good, or I just no longer enjoy post-metal anymore... Every song on this album sounds the same, and the riffs aren't really heavy.

  [6.1/10]

## Perila - Everything Is Already There

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/725112/large/Cover.jpg)

  This one is pretty dope too.

  [8.2/10]

## Claire Rousay - A Softer Focus

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0449631399_10.jpg)

  Soothing field recording / minimal ambient music.

  [7.7/10]

## Salamanda - Glass Cage

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1294252377_16.jpg)

  New-age music from Korea. Is actually pretty nice!

  [7.8/10]

## The Field Mice - Snowball

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1080826840_16.jpg)

  Jangle pop. It's decent, but I bet there are a bunch of bands that are like this.

  [7.4/10]

## Wanton Witch - Wanton Witch

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0161540288_16.jpg)

  Industrial techno / hardcore from Bangkok. I guess this is something that would be much more impressive if played through high quality PA system in a club or livehouse than my bluetooth speakers...

  [7.3/10]

## Spellling - The Turning Wheel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3751659521_16.jpg)

  Gothic synthpop. Sounds like classic Disney cartoons from the 90s. Or a more rock-oriented Kate Bush.

  [7.0/10]

## Fatima Al Qadiri - Medieval Femme

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2688549126_16.jpg)

  Not really digging her stuff from before, although Spotify says I will like her stuff if I enjoy Sophie. This one is mystical and much less of a (hyper)pop album compared to her previous albums, it presents a sparse, semi-deserted ancient city (not sure if it made sense), thanks to the ghostly synth sounds and vocal samples drenched in heavy reverb.

  [7.7/10]

## Don't DJ, NWAQ - Fashion

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1737679625_16.jpg)

  Subterranean club music. I dig it.

  [8.6/10]

## Dos Monos - Dos Siki 2nd Season

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2737bfa334ae89fd58a76d8a6e8)

  Even Jazz Dommunisters is on this EP... dope. Hopefully they do a full-length instead of pumping out a EP once in a while.

  [8.0/10]

## Mica Levi - Blue Alibi

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2960727674_16.jpg)

  I don't know why but I always confuse Mica Levi with Octa Octa... this is left field indie rock + ghostly human voices. Kind of like a less pop focused Dean Blunt. Nothing like Octa Octa...

  [7.7/10]

## Bvdub - Ten Times The World Lied

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2484839523_16.jpg)

  <3 <3 <3

  [8.7/10]

## bdrmm - Bedroom

  ![]()

  Shoegaze. The good kind.

  [8.2/10]
