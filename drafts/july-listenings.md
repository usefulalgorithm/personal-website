## Yo La Tengo - This Stupid World

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0932855106_16.jpg)

  Strong AOTY candidate. So good.

  [9.0/10]

## The Ocean - Holocene

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1499690362_16.jpg)

  Pretty lackluster. The metal tracks don't really feel all that enticing, and the ballads are no better. A far cry from `Anthropocentric`.

  [5.5/10]

## Thantifaxath - Hive Mind Narcosis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3502633251_16.jpg)

  Chaotic avant-garde black metal band is back, and is just as gnarly as before. Menacing stuff.

  [8.2/10]

## Not Waving - The Place I've Been Missing

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3539783518_16.jpg)

  Electronic / ambient pop / trip-hop. Cohesive and beautiful.

  [8.4/10]
