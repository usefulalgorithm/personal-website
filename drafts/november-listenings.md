## 2020 Releases

### Krallice - Mass Cathexis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0574786205_10.jpg)

  At first I was a bit underwhelmed but once I start to actually pay attention to this album I see I was very wrong. This one is bomb... In terms of musical style it somehow reminds me of BTBAM, but quirkier and songs much more condensed. 快去買

  [8.5/10]

### Bill Callahan - Gold Record

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3941009329_10.jpg)

  Blues / country / folk. This one is a lot of fun to listen to, and the songs are super catchy. I think I like this one even more than Shepherd. 開始就在那邊說 "Hello I'm Johnny Cash"， LMAO

  [8.4/10]

### MJ Guider - Sour Cherry Bell

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0751049823_10.jpg)

  Downtempo / shoegaze. FFO Grouper.

  [8.4/10]

### Various Artists - Blue Note Re:imagined

  ![](https://soundarchitecture.nl/image/cache/catalog/cgz-mx-800x800.jpg)

  Bunch of UK artists unite to do a tribute to Blue Note records. Acid jazz / R&B / soul. 好聽

  [8.3/10]

### Emma Ruth Rundle, Thou - May Our Chambers Be Full

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3696645020_10.jpg)

  Another classic from Thou & Co. Somehow it feels like a grunge album...

  [8.2/10]

### Ireen Amnes - In The Land Of Silence

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1151879061_10.jpg)

  Grinding industrial / techno. FFO Vatican Shadow, pretty eerie stuff.

  [8.2/10]

### Gesellschaft Zur Emanzipation Des Samples - Anthology Of American Pop Music

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4245032904_10.jpg)

  Jan Jelinek's alter ego does some dreamy ambient music sampled from alleged pop songs... GES wrote some stuff on their Bandcamp page, pretty interesting read.

  [8.1/10]

### Botanist - Photosynthesis

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3403110590_10.jpg)

  Organic post-black metal. At first I was a bit skeptical about this one but after several spins I think it's one of these rare instances where a band that does a hybrid of post-rock / black metal music doesn't actually suck or claims to be "experimental" but is actually just post-rock with harsh vocals... Oh and this one is very melodic.

  [8.1/10]

### Staraya Derevnya - Inwards Opened The Floor

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2213521169_10.jpg)

  Bizarre ritualistic psychedelic folk music. FFO Swans.

  [8.0/10]

### Bongripper - Glaciers

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2538693043_10.jpg)

  Meditative heavy music. 超不金屬，感覺是那種宿醉窩在床上會聽到睡著的類型

  [8.0/10]

### John Frusciante - Maya

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0769422831_10.jpg)

  It's actually not bad... definitely not what I expected from him though. Drum & Bass / jungle. Pretty retro sound.

  [7.8/10]

### Goldmund - The Time It Takes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2394416331_10.jpg)

  Minimalistic piano ambient.

  [7.8/10]

### Yellow - 浮世擊

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/89289396,3v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Acid jazz / R&B. 除了 Meniere's Buzzing 跟獨上C樓之外，每首歌都編得很好 (那兩首我真的不愛... ) 樂手真的是 played out of their minds，鼓跟貝斯演奏到飛天

  [7.7/10]

### Maarja Nuut & Ruum - World Inverted

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3213908701_10.jpg)

  Techno / experimental electro-folk. I like the more folk leaning parts of this album more, the hard hitting techno parts feels kinda like how a NIN album would sound.

  [7.6/10]

### Mort Garson - Music From Patch Cord Productions

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1023002208_10.jpg)

  More previously unreleased stuff from French electronic music pioneer. This one sounds more mystical, and some tracks feature full band playing along to his synth playing. Personally I still prefer Mother Earth's Plantasia though.

  [7.6/10]

### Gaika - Seguridad

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1567384387_10.jpg)

  Dreamy futuristic pop. Never really felt attached to his stuff though...

  [7.3/10]

### Angel-Ho - Alla Prima

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1026556242_10.jpg)

  Contorted experimental trap-pop. Basically it's what you'd expect from Hyperdub.

  [7.2/10]

### Loscil - Faults, Coasts, Lines

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3883473497_10.jpg)

  Soothing cinematic ambient / post-rock / field recording. It's like music you'd hear at a museum and you'd be like, "the music is alright", and then you get on with the rest of the exhibition without really paying attention to the music.

  [7.0/10]

### Yo La Tengo - Sleepless Nights

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/688868/large/Unknown.jpg)

  YTL does soothing country covers.

  [6.8/10]

### The Killers - Imploding The Mirage

  ![](https://www.thekillersmusic.com/sites/g/files/aaj4551/f/styles/suzuki_breakpoints_image_mobile-lg_sq/public/release/202008/ab67616d0000b273cda9b715df60a7d8fe0a9d62.jpg?itok=H7STFLl1)

  Arena rock / synth-pop. 聽了幾首決定這張其實還是沒有很好聽

  [5.2/10]

### Mammal Hands - Captured Spirits

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2396058704_10.jpg)

  Uninspiring nu-jazz. 趙正媛說不好聽

  [5.0/10]

### Cloudkicker - Solitude

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3216428789_10.jpg)

  Cloudkicker 還是聽 Beacons 就好了，其他的都差不多... 這張則是特別無聊

  [4.3/10]

### Mr. Bungle - The Raging Wrath Of The Easter Bunny Demo

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4225317696_10.jpg)

  Goofy thrash metal.

  [3.8/10]

## Non-2020 Releases

### Jake Muir

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3144064782_10.jpg)

  Field recording / ambient. Psychedelic stuff.

  [8.5/10]

### Function - Existenz

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/617992/large/0666017339726.jpg)

  House. Though this album is over an hour long it never feels stagnating. Love this one

  [8.1/10]

### Rothko - Severed Tense

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0670180781_10.jpg)

  It's basically an extremely twisted bass solo. Experimental post-rock / drone.

  [7.3/10]

### Roska - Perception

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0471374843_10.jpg)

  UK grime / tribal bass. Feels a bit single dimensional.

  [7.0/10]

### Battles - Juice B Crypts

  ![](https://d1rgjmn2wmqeif.cloudfront.net/r/g/139767-1.jpg)

  感覺隨著他們年紀越來越大，出的專輯好像也變得沒那麼有趣了一點... 當然還是有些部分是不錯的，只是比起一開始那一張真的是差有點多

  [6.7/10]

### Bruce Haack - The Electric Lucifer

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2881262270_10.jpg)

  Psychedelic synth-rock. One of the first few guys to seriously do music with Moog synths?

  [6.5/10]
