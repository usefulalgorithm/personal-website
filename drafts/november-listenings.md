## M. Sage, Zander Raymond - Parayellowgram

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1956443101_16.jpg)

  Ambient cosmic jazz. Reminds me of some of Tortoise's subtler tracks on `TNT`.

  [8.1/10]

## Shabazz Palace - Robed in Rareness

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3885293863_16.jpg)

  At this point I don't know if this album's low effort or `Black Up` is just an anomaly.

  [5.3/10]

## L'Rain - I Killed Your Dog

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2508700233_16.jpg)

  Indie dream-pop / neo-soul. Wonky but tender, generally just a great pop album.

  [8.3/10]

## Lost Girls - Selvutsletter

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3511004309_16.jpg)

  While `Menneskekollektivet` is epic, brooding and more "serious", `Selvutsletter` is pure dark avant-pop goodiness.

  [8.3/10]

## Colleen - Le jour et la nuit du réel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1521320280_16.jpg)

  Synth music with a lot of delays. When I first listened to this I wasnt paying attention and thought it’s ok but not something really spectacular, but then I stopped doing things and listened and it was truly magical.

  [8.4/10]

## 38 Spesh, Conway the Machine - Speshal Machinery

  ![](https://images.genius.com/8456476c8c85074f68408e1d80f4ccf4.1000x1000x1.jpg)

  Conscious hip-hop. The Benny the butcher feature track is dope AF. I been digging Conway the Machine a lot and this project does not disappoint.

  [8.1/10]

## Cameron Graham - Becoming a Beach Angel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1706283989_16.jpg)

  Colorful percussive synth music.

  [7.5/10]

## Danny Brown - Quaranta

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3189957632_16.jpg)

  The first half was pretty good, the second was kinda lackluster.

  [6.6/10]

## Ragana - Desolations Flower

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2479212504_16.jpg)

  Post black metal. It’s alright.

  [6.8/10]

## Black Thought, El Michels Affair - Glorious Game

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4239568242_16.jpg)

  Cconscious hip-hop. The beats are sick and the flows are dope.

  [8.3/10]

## André 3000 - New Blue Sun

  ![](https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/65537cbc3cc93f9b90ee453e/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Andre-3000-New-Blue-Sun.jpg)

  New age improv / ambient. I like the tracks where the flaut isn't so up front better, like the third and fourth track. The album as a whole feels kind of drawn out, the ideas just take too long to develop into interesting things and when that happens it is also not really that interesting. That said I'll still be looking out for André's coming up releases and see what he brings to the table.

  [6.6/10]

## Aesop Rock - Integrated Tech Solutions

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0251711775_16.jpg)

  Abstract hip-hop. The forte of this album is definitely his lyrics, most of all his ability to pin down the snippets of things that are simply beyond the grasp of seemingly ubiquitous technological domination. Even though the title is `Integrated Tech Solutions`, the songs are about the copmlete opposite. As for production I think the individual tracks are pretty good, but 15+ songs with very similar BPMs, grimey rhythms and bass synths, after like 5 songs it gets repetitive.

  [7.6/10]

## Sleep Sinatra, TELEVANGEL - Incorruptible Saints

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0378415185_16.jpg)

  Boom-bap / jazz-rap.

  [7.9/10]

## Niecy Blues - Exit Simulation

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0427758249_16.jpg)

  Ambient / R&B / downtempo. It sounds like a weird combination, but it actually makes sense.

  [8.3/10]

## Rainy Miller & Space Afrika - A Grisaille Wedding

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3955577135_16.jpg)

  Ambient drill / trip-hop / spoken word. I love this album a lot.
