## Lynyn - Lexicon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0055427972_16.jpg)

  Kinetic IDM. Normally I'd find this kind of stuff a little hard to sit thru, but not this one.

  [8.2/10]

## Dry Cleaning - Stumpwork

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2082562256_16.jpg)

  Post-punk-y Stereolab? Or at least it gives me that kind of vibe. But then I guess I would stick to just pure Stereolab...

  [7.1/10]

## Girl In Synthesis - The Rest is Distraction

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1786802869_16.jpg)

  Noisy post-punk. I dig the riffs and vibe on this one.

  [8.1/10]

## Emeralds - Solar Bridge

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1984358756_16.jpg)

  Sparwling electronic drone.

  [8.4/10]

## Ripatti Deluxe - Speed Demon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0900556404_16.jpg)

  Gets repetitive after a while. Still dig the Vladislav Delay project the most.

  [6.3/10]

## Oren Ambarchi - Shebang

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0393255258_16.jpg)

  Droning jazz. Like Bill Frisell but less friendly... I dig this a lot.

  [8.3/10]

## Angry Son - Pranks for the Memory

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2542860774_16.jpg)

  Screamo. I like the angrier songs on this EP, but even so they're not really that good...

  [6.8/10]

## Sudan Archives - Natural Brown Prom Queen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1589291795_16.jpg)

  R&B / pop. This one is extremely well received but to be honest I really don't get the hype...

  [7.0/10]

## Duval Timothy - Meeting with a Judas Tree

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0471216186_16.jpg)

  Wonky, warbly R&B solo piano. I dig this.

  [8.4/10]

## Daniel Avery - Ultra Truth
