## Lynyn - Lexicon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0055427972_16.jpg)

  Kinetic IDM. Normally I'd find this kind of stuff a little hard to sit thru, but not this one.

  [8.2/10]

## Dry Cleaning - Stumpwork

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2082562256_16.jpg)

  Post-punk-y Stereolab? Or at least it gives me that kind of vibe. But then I guess I would stick to just pure Stereolab...

  [7.1/10]

## Girl In Synthesis - The Rest is Distraction

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1786802869_16.jpg)

  Noisy post-punk. I dig the riffs and vibe on this one.

  [8.1/10]

## Emeralds - Solar Bridge

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1984358756_16.jpg)

  Sparwling electronic drone.

  [8.4/10]

## Ripatti Deluxe - Speed Demon

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0900556404_16.jpg)

  Gets repetitive after a while. Still dig the Vladislav Delay project the most.

  [6.3/10]

## Oren Ambarchi - Shebang

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0393255258_16.jpg)

  Droning jazz. Like Bill Frisell but less friendly... I dig this a lot.

  [8.3/10]

## Angry Son - Pranks for the Memory

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2542860774_16.jpg)

  Screamo. I like the angrier songs on this EP, but even so they're not really that good...

  [6.8/10]

## Sudan Archives - Natural Brown Prom Queen

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1589291795_16.jpg)

  R&B / pop. This one is extremely well received but to be honest I really don't get the hype...

  [7.0/10]

## Duval Timothy - Meeting with a Judas Tree

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0471216186_16.jpg)

  Wonky, warbly R&B solo piano. I dig this.

  [8.4/10]

## Horse Lords - Comradely Objects

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0155432732_16.jpg)

  This one feels a lot more conventional than their earlier stuff. Or maybe conventional is not the correct way to describe this, but that this is an album where you can find many similarity with a lot of other bands like Black Midi, The Comet is Coming and so on.

  [7.7/10]

## Moin - Paste

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0190779692_16.jpg)

  Math-rock / post-hardcore. Really glad there are still people making this kind of music.

  [8.6/10]

## Rival Consoles - Now Is

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1538288243_16.jpg)

  This is more fun than their album from last year.

  [7.3/10]

## Daniel Avery - Ultra Truth

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2631565452_16.jpg)

  Club-friendly ambient techno. I can imagine me banging my head to it if I go to a club (I don't) and the DJ is playing this, but when I'm listening alone I'd stick with `Song for Alpha` instead of this.

  [7.4/10]
