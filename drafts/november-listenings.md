## James Blake - Friends That Break Your Heart

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/127495377,3v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Electro-indie-pop. This is definitely better than 2019's Assume Form, but is still no where near his self-titled LP from a while back. The songs that features only himself are better than the ones with other featured guests.

  [7.1/10]

## Busdriver - Jhelli Beam

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/64842389,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Experimental hip-hop / abstract rap. I get that the dude must be really talented but his talents are definitely not on full display in this album.

  [6.3/10]

## Trustfall - Trustfall

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2656247263_16.jpg)

  Gothic pop. Kind of reminds me of a more restrained Arca or a more approachable David Sylvian. OK but not great.

  [7.2/10]

## BADBADNOTGOOD - Talk Memory

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0196386795_16.jpg)

  Fusion. The first couple of songs sounds like Dungen's instrumental tracks, and overall it's more jazz oriented than the lo-fi hip-hop sound they've been known for.

  [7.5/10]

## Soho Rezanejad - Honesty Without Compassion is Brutality, Vol. 2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2784097236_16.jpg)

  Dramatic experimental pop music. On this album her vocal prowess is on full display - sometimes it sounds like Jenny Hval, sometimes it sounds like King Woman.

  [8.1/10]

## Marina Rosenfeld - Teenage Lontano

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0252419004_16.jpg)

  This is the recording of two different sound art happenings. The first suite is avant-garde choral music, glossolalia music? Second suite is like a bunch of R&B songs stacked on dissonant electronic sounds. Eerie stuff but oddly comforting...

  The [Bandcamp page](https://room40.bandcamp.com/album/teenage-lontano) for the album contains a lot more information, such as the locations and the meanings of those pieces.

  [7.8/10]
