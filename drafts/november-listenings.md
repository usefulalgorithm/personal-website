## James Blake - Friends That Break Your Heart

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/127495377,3v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Electro-indie-pop. This is definitely better than 2019's Assume Form, but is still no where near his self-titled LP from a while back. The songs that features only himself are better than the ones with other featured guests.

  [7.1/10]

## Busdriver - Jhelli Beam

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/64842389,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Experimental hip-hop / abstract rap. I get that the dude must be really talented but his talents are definitely not on full display in this album.

  [6.3/10]

## Trustfall - Trustfall

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2656247263_16.jpg)

  Gothic pop. Kind of reminds me of a more restrained Arca or a more approachable David Sylvian. OK but not great.

  [7.2/10]

## Breakwater - Five 7"

  ![](https://img.discogs.com/rsBEPe37lwolx1M3mSkgdl3BRIk=/fit-in/600x600/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/R-2427437-1421761724-9241.jpeg.jpg)

  Obscure emo / screamo gem. Pretty dope.

  [7.8/10]

## snd - Tenderlove

  ![](https://assets.boomkat.com/spree/products/202640/large/original.jpg)

  Minimal techno like how it should be. Pretty good. And I snatched it for 5 bucks...

  [8.1/10]

## BADBADNOTGOOD - Talk Memory

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0196386795_16.jpg)

  Fusion. The first couple of songs sounds like Dungen's instrumental tracks, and overall it's more jazz oriented than the lo-fi hip-hop sound they've been known for.

  [7.5/10]

## Phase Selector Sound - Disassemble Dub

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2647605047_16.jpg)

  I've been looking for a dub record like this for so long, and it's just sitting there in the drawer the whole time...

  [8.8/10]

## Modern Love - The Stranger

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4239985214_16.jpg)

  Evil Caretaker be like.

  [8.1/10]

## Christophe De Babalon - 044 (Hilf Dir Selbst!)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2769895167_16.jpg)

  Gothic drum & bass. Man this is tight.

  [8.6/10]

## Soho Rezanejad - Honesty Without Compassion is Brutality, Vol. 2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2784097236_16.jpg)

  Dramatic experimental pop music. On this album her vocal prowess is on full display - sometimes it sounds like Jenny Hval, sometimes it sounds like King Woman.

  [7.8/10]

## Portrayal of Guilt - CHRISTFUCKER

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0619008894_16.jpg)

  Another lackluster release from once-promising hardcore band... maybe this is what should've been expected all along...

  [5.8/10]

## 當代電影大師 - 告訴我他們都在本來的什麼地方

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/141162911,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  There is a pretty drastic improvement from their EP to this one. I still dislike the vocals (and the lyrics... man are they cringey), and overall the songs are all lacking in the bass frequencies, though this is due to Spotify shitting on qualities of uploaded songs... But the songs where they appropriated other bands like 草東 or 透明雜誌 are fun to listen to.

  [6.3/10]

## Various Artists - Sound Storing Machines: The First 78rpm Records from Japan, 1903 1912

  ![](https://s9.limitedrun.com/images/1499631/v600_SF115-promo-cover.jpg)

  A compilation of really ancient Japanese music recordings. A sublime listen.

  [8.4/10]

## Marina Rosenfeld - Teenage Lontano

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0252419004_16.jpg)

  This is the recording of two different sound art happenings. The first suite is avant-garde choral music, glossolalia music? Second suite is like a bunch of R&B songs stacked on dissonant electronic sounds. Eerie stuff but oddly comforting...

  The [Bandcamp page](https://room40.bandcamp.com/album/teenage-lontano) for the album contains a lot more information, such as the locations and the meanings of those pieces.

  [7.8/10]

## Various Artists - "I Could Go Anywhere But Again I Go With You"

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3834878114_16.jpg)

  The music you hear when you enter a shrine in Breath of the Wild.

  [8.2/10]

## Full Of Hell - Garden of Burning Apparitions

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0377815917_16.jpg)

  The guitar tone in this album sounds more like alt rock than death metal... which I kind of enjoy. Some songs are less powerful than others but the ones that are good are really pretty good.

  [7.5/10]

## Kid Koala - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/34133739,0v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Eccentric lo-fi hip-hop. Lots of fun to listen to.

  [8.1/10]

## aya - im hole

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1852362800_16.jpg)

  Eerie experimental electronic pop. Claustrophobic stuff, and yet it is so good...

  [8.3/10]

## Leah Dou - GSG MIXTAPE

  ![]()

  Chill-hop. Not bad but not really my mood.

  [7.3/10]

## Kidcrash - Jokes

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0311275015_16.jpg)

  Screamo-ish math rock. The riffs are pretty cool.

  [7.8/10]

## Curd Duca - Waves 2

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a4023416576_16.jpg)

  Sequel to last year's fantastic `Waves 1`, and just as exhilarating to listen to.

  [8.5/10]

## Grouper - Shade

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3255860031_16.jpg)

  Hypnotic bedroom pop / folk. Very stripped back yet powerful.

  [8.3/10]

## Novi_sad - Κεραυνός

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2901662245_16.jpg)

  Organic ambient music.

  [8.2/10]
