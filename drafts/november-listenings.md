## James Blake - Friends That Break Your Heart

  ![](https://i.kfs.io/album/global/127495377,3v1/fit/500x500.jpg)

  Electro-indie-pop. This is definitely better than 2019's Assume Form, but is still no where near his self-titled LP from a while back. The songs that features only himself are better than the ones with other featured guests.

  [7.1/10]
