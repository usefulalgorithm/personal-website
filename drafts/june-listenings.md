## Colleen - The Tunnel and the Clearing

  ![]()

  I can listen to this all day. Shadowy, soft electronic / ambient.

  [8.8/10]

## Boo Hiss - Sike Roc

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0394747746_16.jpg)

  Cut-n-paste sample music? Anyway I like this.

  [8.3/10]

## Black Midi - Cavalcade

  ![]()

  I like this more than their debut album. Or maybe it's because I'm not really familiar with that one... Chaotic, all-over-the-place (in the nicest sense of the word) math-rock.

  [8.1/10]

## Loraine James - Reflection

  ![]()

  TBH I like her stunning debut from two years ago more than this one. This one just feels more tame, less wonky and freakish. But it's still pretty good though.

  [7.8/10]

## Jimmy Edgar - Cheetah Bend

  ![]()

  Trap. Although I like a lot of the additional artists featured on this album, this album feels one dimensional and doesn't really do them justice.

  [6.5/10]

## Khotin - Finds You Well

  ![]()

  Who would not like this...

  [8.6/10]

## LA Timpa - Modern Antics in a Deserted Place

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0921754968_16.jpg)

  Dreamy bedroom avant-pop. I like it.

  [8.5/10]

## Various Artists - ùëîùìÅùí∂ùìÇùëúùìäùìá¬∞

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1179243115_16.jpg)

  An explosive compilation of deconstructed club music. Wicked.

  [8.3/10]

## Bedwetter - Vol. 1: Flick Your Tongue Against Your Teeth and Describe the Present

  ![]()

  Awesome abstract hip-hop. Every track on this album is a banger, literally 30 minutes of bliss.

  [8.7/10]

## Arca - Madre

  ![]()

  It's kind of annoying.

  [6.2/10]

## Lanark Artefax - Whities 001

  ![]()

  Not as abrasive and memorable as the outstanding Corra Linn from 2019, but still pretty good.

  [7.8/10]

## Miriam Makeba - Keep Me In Mind

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3470282908_16.jpg)

  Root / pop from 1974 just got reissued. The songs are pretty good but it's just not something I'd listen to on a regular basis. Maybe people who dig the retro R&B / pop sound would enjoy this more? That being said the lady is very revolutionary, and her story is truly incredible, would very much recommend the viewer to read up on her biography.

  [7.6/10]

## Veld Hans - The Becalming

  ![]()

  Lo-fi freak folk. Pretty good, pretty weird.

  [8.0/10]

## Eomac - Cracks

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3503474868_10.jpg)

  Techno / IDM.

  [7.5/10]

## Dean Blunt - Black Metal 2

  ![]()

  Hypnagogic indie-pop / cloud hip-hop. Comparing this to Black Metal feels like pitting The Matrix 2 against the obviously vasly superior first film.

  [6.5/10]

## The Body - I've Seen All I Want To See

  ![]()

  Anthony Fantano is right in saying that despite this album is the duo's most stripped down album to date, it is also their nastiest album. I'd still say this isn't as good as their collab albums with other groups like Thou, Full Of Hell, and Uniform, but still this is their best so far.

  [7.7/10]

## Death Is Not The End - Death Is Not The End

  ![]()

  So apparently one of the record labels that specialize in preserving sounds from the past decides to make music... I like this a lot, dreamy lo-fi music, FFO The Caretaker.

  [8.2/10]

## YL Hooi - Untitled

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0192973536_10.jpg)

  Hazy ambientronica / dub-ish bedroom music. Pretty good, it's something while not mindblowingly good still really enjoyable.

  [7.7/10]

## Êù±‰∫¨‰∫ãÂ§â - Èü≥Ê•Ω

  ![](https://cdn.japan-walker.net/hk/images/articles/2618/img_6082498621c55.jpeg)

  Very lackluster. They can play but musically speaking there's nothing new in this album. And the mixing and production on this album is so bad, whoever did these should be ashamed of themselves...

  [3.3/10]

## Kenny Segal - Indoors

  ![]()

  One of the best beatmakers in the game strikes again.  Lo-fi jazz-hop goodness.

  [8.4/10]

## Pandit Pam Pam - Quarto Relatorio Anual

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3634736051_10.jpg)

  Dub ambient / techno.

  [8.3/10]

## Senyawa, Black To Comm - Alkisah Versi Hitam

  ![](https://www.normanrecords.com/artwork/medium/82/187332-senyawa-vs-black-to-comm-alkisah-versi-hitam.jpg)

  [7.5/10]

## Peder Mannerfelt - And The Band Played On

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0850111470_16.jpg)

  Danceable, wonky percussive techno. Gets a bit tired after a while though, except for the last track which is dissonant and chaotic, full granular synth bliss.

  [7.4/10]

## The Alchemist - This Thing Of Ours

  ![]()

  Jazz-hop EP from one of the most well-known beatmakers in the game, featuring a bunch of big names like Pink Siifu and Earl Sweatshirt. That being said, this is not really all that memorable, and the songs are just OK.

  [7.0/10]

## Chihei Hatakeyama - Late Spring

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1938248117_16.jpg)

  This one might be my favorite amongst all his stuff...

  [8.5/10]

## Basic Rhythm - Electronic Labyrinth

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0420424914_16.jpg)

  Bouncy techno / grime. Love the tracks Electronic Labyrinth and Larkin Around.

  [8.2/10]

## Sugai Ken - On The Quakefish

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0206012711_10.jpg)

  Japanese ambient / new-age. Meditative sound, delicate stuff.

  [8.4/10]

## Steven R. Smith - In The Spires

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1512355904_16.jpg)

  Sounds like the soundtrack to Red Dead Redemption or something. Somber old western music.

  [7.6/10]
