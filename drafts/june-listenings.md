## Luminous Vault - Animate the Emptiness

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0898364167_16.jpg)

  Black metal guitars meet industrial vibes. Like Godflesh playing black metal? Anyways this stuff is right up my alley.

  [8.3/10]

## Rachika Nayar - Our Hands Against the Dusk

  ![]()

  Compared to fragments this is more ambient, more heavy on reverb. I like the arpeggios at the end of the first track `The Trembling of Glass`.

  [7.6/10]

## Pyramids - A Northern Meadow

  ![]()

  I knew this was gonna be a banger but somehow I never really listened to this... until I found out one of them is actually a member of TheSounds of Animals Fighting. It's kind of like maudlin of the well, but less experimental and more black metal. It is indeed very intense.

  [7.8/10]

## Mach Hommy - Dollar Menu

  ![]()

  The first and the last songs are dope, the others only mid-tier.

  [6.8/10]

## DJ Rozwell - None of This is Real

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3061876186_16.jpg)

  Instrumental cloud-rap. FFO cLOUDDEAD... really good stuff.

  [8.5/10]

## Hermit and the Recluse - Orpheus vs. the Sirens

  ![]()

  Every track on this album is a banger. Love this.

  [8.7/10]

## Cities Aviv - GUM

  ![]()

  Hypnagogic rap. Really like his production.

  [8.3/10]

## Meshuggah - Immutable

  ![]()

  Better than their last one (by a considerable margin), but I guess this kind of music just doesn't get me anymore.

  [6.3/10]

## S A D - Children of the Sun

  ![]()

  FFO Meitei & new-age ambient.

  [7.5/10]

## E L U C I D - I Told Bessie

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2738953678_16.jpg)

  2022 is indeed a strong year for alternative hip-hop... maybe there'll be a new Armand Hammer release later this year? While his previous albums all felt like they were missing the target, this one is much more cohesive and really feels enjoyable.

  [7.8/10]

## Quelle Chris - Deathfame
