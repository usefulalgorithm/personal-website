## Colleen - The Tunnel and the Clearing

  ![]()

  I can listen to this all day. Shadowy, soft electronic / ambient.

  [8.8/10]

## Boo Hiss - Sike Roc

  Cut-n-paste sample music? Anyway I like this.

  [8.3/10]

## Black Midi - Cavalcade

  ![]()

  I like this more than their debut album. Or maybe it's because I'm not really familiar with that one... Chaotic, all-over-the-place (in the nicest sense of the word) math-rock.

  [8.1/10]

## Loraine James - Reflection

  ![]()

  TBH I like her stunning debut from two years ago more than this one. This one just feels more tame, less wonky and freakish. But it's still pretty good though.

  [7.8/10]

## Jimmy Edgar - Cheetah Bend

  ![]()

  Trap. Although I like a lot of the additional artists featured on this album, this album feels one dimensional and doesn't really do them justice.

  [6.5/10]

## Khotin - Finds You Well

  ![]()

  Who would not like this...

  [8.6/10]

## LA Timpa - Modern Antics in a Deserted Place

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0921754968_16.jpg)

  Dreamy bedroom avant-pop. I like it.

  [8.5/10]

## Various Artists - 𝑔𝓁𝒶𝓂𝑜𝓊𝓇°

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1179243115_16.jpg)

  An explosive compilation of deconstructed club music. Wicked.

  [8.3/10]

## Bedwetter - Vol. 1: Flick Your Tongue Against Your Teeth and Describe the Present

  ![]()

  Awesome abstract hip-hop. Every track on this album is a banger, literally 30 minutes of bliss.

  [8.7/10]

## Arca - Madre

  ![]()

  It's kind of annoying.

  [6.2/10]

## Lanark Artefax - Whities 001

  ![]()

  Not as abrasive and memorable as the outstanding Corra Linn from 2019, but still pretty good.

  [7.8/10]

## Miriam Makeba - Keep Me In Mind

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3470282908_16.jpg)

  Root / pop from 1974 just got reissued. The songs are pretty good but it's just not something I'd listen to on a regular basis. Maybe people who dig the retro R&B / pop sound would enjoy this more? That being said the lady is very revolutionary, and her story is truly incredible, would very much recommend the viewer to read up on her biography.

  [7.6/10]

## Veld Hans - The Becalming

  ![]()

  Lo-fi freak folk. Pretty good, pretty weird.

  [8.0/10]

## Eomac - Cracks

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3503474868_10.jpg)

  Techno / IDM.

  [7.5/10]

## Dean Blunt - Black Metal 2

  ![]()

  Hypnagogic indie-pop / cloud hip-hop. Comparing this to Black Metal feels like pitting The Matrix 2 against the obviously vasly superior first film.

  [6.5/10]

## The Body - I've Seen All I Want To See

  ![]()

  Anthony Fantano is right in saying that despite this album is the duo's most stripped down album to date, it is also their nastiest album. I'd still say this isn't as good as their collab albums with other groups like Thou, Full Of Hell, and Uniform, but still this is their best so far.

  [7.7/10]
