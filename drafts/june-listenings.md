## 2021 Releases

### Black Midi - Cavalcade

  ![]()

  I like this more than their debut album. Or maybe it's because I'm not really familiar with that one... Chaotic, all-over-the-place (in the nicest sense of the word) math-rock.

  [8.1/10]

### Jimmy Edgar - Cheetah Bend

  ![]()

  Trap. Although I like a lot of the additional artists featured on this album, this album feels one dimensional and doesn't really do them justice.

  [6.5/10]

## 2020 Releases

### Khotin - Finds You Well

  ![]()

  Who would not like this...

  [8.6/10]

## 2019 Releases

### Various Artists - 𝑔𝓁𝒶𝓂𝑜𝓊𝓇°

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1179243115_16.jpg)

  An explosive compilation of deconstructed club music. Wicked.

  [8.3/10]

## 2017 Releases

### Bedwetter - Vol. 1: Flick Your Tongue Against Your Teeth and Describe the Present

  ![]()

  Awesome abstract hip-hop. Every track on this album is a banger, literally 30 minutes of bliss.

  [8.7/10]
