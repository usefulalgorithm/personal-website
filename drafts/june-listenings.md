## Luminous Vault - Animate the Emptiness

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0898364167_16.jpg)

  Black metal guitars meet industrial vibes. Like Godflesh playing black metal? Anyways this stuff is right up my alley.

  [8.3/10]

## Rachika Nayar - Our Hands Against the Dusk

  ![]()

  Compared to fragments this is more ambient, more heavy on reverb. I like the arpeggios at the end of the first track `The Trembling of Glass`.

  [7.6/10]

## Pyramids - A Northern Meadow

  ![]()

  I knew this was gonna be a banger but somehow I never really listened to this... until I found out one of them is actually a member of TheSounds of Animals Fighting. It's kind of like maudlin of the well, but less experimental and more black metal. It is indeed very intense.

  [7.8/10]

## Mach Hommy - Dollar Menu

  ![]()

  The first and the last songs are dope, the others only mid-tier.

  [6.8/10]

## DJ Rozwell - None of This is Real

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3061876186_16.jpg)

  Instrumental cloud-rap. FFO cLOUDDEAD... really good stuff.

  [8.5/10]

## Hermit and the Recluse - Orpheus vs. the Sirens

  ![]()

  Every track on this album is a banger. Love this.

  [8.7/10]

## Cities Aviv - GUM

  ![]()

  Hypnagogic rap. Really like his production.

  [8.3/10]

## Meshuggah - Immutable

  ![]()

  Better than their last one (by a considerable margin), but I guess this kind of music just doesn't get me anymore.

  [6.3/10]

## S A D - Children of the Sun

  ![]()

  FFO Meitei & new-age ambient.

  [7.5/10]

## E L U C I D - I Told Bessie

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2738953678_16.jpg)

  2022 is indeed a strong year for alternative hip-hop... maybe there'll be a new Armand Hammer release later this year? While his previous albums all felt like they were missing the target, this one is much more cohesive and really feels enjoyable.

  [7.8/10]

## Best Available Technology - Fixing Until Broke

  ![]()

  Ambient… or more precisely lo-do cloud rap tronica. Dope stuff.

  [8.3/10]

## Quells Chris - Deathfame

  ![]()

  Took me several listens to fully appreciate it… this is a good one.

  [8.4/10]

## Mach Hommy - HBO (Haitian Body Odor)

  ![]()

  This probably should’ve been his first album I listen to… a concept album centered around Haiti, very nicely executed east coast hip-hop with splendid jazz hop beats.

  [8.2/10]

## Cremation Lily - Dreams Drenched in Static

  ![]()

  Industrial noise-pop. Think less refined, less slithery Sega Bodega.

  [7.4/10]

## Ghais Guevara - Black Bolshevik

  ![]()

  Political hip-hop with JPEGMAFIA aspirations. The bars aren't that crazy though.

  [6.6/10]

## Whatever the Weather - Whatever the Weather

  ![]()

  ... I think this is probably my favorite LJ release? It's got ambient, minial techno, drum & bass, and then it sounds like one coherent album instead of a mish mash of things. Really good stuff.

  [8.7/10]

## Boldy James, The Alchemist - Bo Jackson

  ![]()

  Griselda Records is on a strong streak these days... at first I didn't really pay attention to Boldy's lyrics, but damn these bars are really sick. The Alchemist on the other hand is doing his usual stuff: awesome beats that go flawlessly with the flow. Really good stuff.

  [8.3/10]

## Daniel Rossen - You Belong Here

  ![]()

  Freak folk / chamber pop. There are a bunch of quirky parts on this album, some even reminding me of earlier Richard Dawson stuff.

  [8.2/10]

## Sofie Birch - Holotropica

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1325560746_16.jpg)

  ... I guess I am really late to the party. Intricate, therapeutic ambient.

  [8.5/10]

## Luis - 057 (Schwyn)

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1656797036_16.jpg)

  Joyous IDM.

  [7.7/10]

## Maxo - LIL BIG MAN

  ![]()

  Down jazz-rap.

  [7.2/10]

## Priori - Your Own Power

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1345121876_16.jpg)

  Cozy house / dub techno.

  [7.8/10]

## Ricardo Villalobos, Samuel Rohrer - Microgestures

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3591773298_16.jpg)

  Villalobos' `RE: ECM` felt way too abstract for me when I heard it a while back... this one in contrast is very enjoyable minial techno.

  [8.1/10]
