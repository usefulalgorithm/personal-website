## 2021 Releases

### Matt Sweeney, Bonnie Price Billy - Superwolves

  ![]()

  Country. BPB is still on top of the game, love this one.

  [8.3/10]

### Maxwell Sterling - Turn Of Phrase

  ![]()

  Crystalline electronic ambient.

  [8.2/10]

### Yukika - Timeabout,

  ![]()

  Another stellar future pop EP from an artist on top of the K-pop game (not that I'm too indulgent on the genre though). Although one can argue there really isn't a whole lot of new ideas on this album, the songs on this album is undeniably catchy and enjoyable.

  [8.1/10]

### Mark Fell, Will Guthrie - Infoldings / Diffractions

  ![]()

  If there ever is a club that plays "Infoldings" on repeat and no drink spilt on the floor and people go there to read books instead of talking about nothing until getting completely wasted, I'd go there regularly.

  [8.1/10]

### Leon Vynehall - Rare, Forever

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2269452384_16.jpg)

  Highly enjoyable, slithering club music. I like the first several tracks like "Ecce! Ego" and "Mothra" a lot, but the latter tracks don't really stand out that much.

  [7.8/10]

### Scuare - Phenomenal

  ![]()

  Chill-hop. Not bad but not really my jam.
  
  [7.3/10]

### Burial, Blackdown - Shock Power Of Love EP

  ![]()

  Compared to Burial's other stuff this one is tame.

  [6.8/10]

### Flying Lotus - Yasuke

  ![]()

  How can this be so bland?

  [6.3/10]

### th1r3en, Pharoahe Monch - A Magnificent Day For An Exorcism

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3094508516_10.jpg)

  Imagine rap-rock, but the "rock" here refers to the kind of music from Led Zeppelin...

  [6.0/10]

## 2020 Releases

### Teller Bank$ - The Grotesque & Beautiful

  ![]()

  Chill-hop. The beat is fluid and the flows are dope.

  [8.1/10]

### KMRU, Ian Urbina - burmaa (Inspired by 'The Outlaw Ocean' a book by Ian Urbina)

  ![]()

  I've always had the impression that while KMRU is one of my favorite ambient music acts right now, they're consciously staying away from using more straightforward melodies in their music. This is not the case on this EP though.

  [7.8/10]

## 2013 Releases

### Bataille Solaire - Documentaires

  ![]()

  Dunno where this band is from, but this sounds a lot like those Japanese new-age ambient music from the previous century. Good stuff.

  [8.2/10]
