## 2021 Releases

### Matt Sweeney, Bonnie Price Billy - Superwolves

  ![]()

  Country. BPB is still on top of the game, love this one.

  [8.3/10]

### Yukika - Timeabout,

  ![]()

  Another stellar future pop EP from an artist on top of the K-pop game (not that I'm too indulgent on the genre though). Although one can argue there really isn't a whole lot of new ideas on this album, the songs on this album is undeniably catchy and enjoyable.

  [8.1/10]

## 2020 Releases

### KMRU, Ian Urbina - burmaa (Inspired by 'The Outlaw Ocean' a book by Ian Urbina)

  ![]()

  I've always had the impression that while KMRU is one of my favorite ambient music acts right now, they're consciously staying away from using more straightforward melodies in their music. This is not the case on this EP though.

  [7.8/10]
