## Huerco S. - Plonk

  ![]()

## o` - Moment Mist Glass Mayflower

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3061666326_16.jpg)

  Crystalline ambient / techno. I really like stuff like this, if only this is longer...

  [8.3/10]

## Beats Unlimited - Beats Unlimited

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0427835129_16.jpg)

  Microhouse / dub techno. Not exactly a bad album but also not something that leaves a lot of impression on me.

  [7.1/10]

## caroline - caroline

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1080116247_16.jpg)

  Indie-folk. It's kind of like Ian William Craig doing midewest emo, if you can imagine that.

  [8.0/10]

## Rerekat - Balance Through Imbalance

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0570717355_16.jpg)

  Dancefloor friendly, hardhitting techno.

  [7.5/10]

## Misantrop - Reproaching the Absurd

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2870201044_16.jpg)

  Wonky noise / techno. Or when club music goes horribly wrong, when everyone's left the venue and it's only the things not from this world that are on the floor.

  At times it is a bit too abrasive though, I dig the atmosphere but this is not something you'd want to put on repeat.

  [7.8/10]

## Abul Mogard - In a Few Places Along the River

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2635090814_16.jpg)

  One day I was chilling on the couch, and wanted to play his earlier stuff on YouTube and just stare at the sky turn from bright to navy blue. But then whenever a song ends the UberEat commercial always popped up, so it's not exactly the most satisfying experience...

  [8.6/10]

## Loscil - The Sails, Pt. 1

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0218507437_16.jpg)

  Pulsating ambient.

  [7.5/10]

## Tomu DJ - FEMINISTA

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3097139372_16.jpg)

  It's like The Field's `Cupid's Head` but even more organic and vibe-y.

  [8.0/10]

## Krallice, Dave Edwardson - Lo√ºm

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2146799252_16.jpg)

  This one has a lot of melodic passages, which I like a lot. The last track is something I think I'll learn when I have time.

  [8.1/10]
