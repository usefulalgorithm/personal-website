## Huerco S. - Plonk

  ![]()

## o` - Moment Mist Glass Mayflower

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3061666326_16.jpg)

  Crystalline ambient / techno. I really like stuff like this, if only this is longer...

  [8.3/10]

## Beats Unlimited - Beats Unlimited

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0427835129_16.jpg)

  Microhouse / dub techno. Not exactly a bad album but also not something that leaves a lot of impression on me.

  [7.1/10]

## caroline - caroline

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1080116247_16.jpg)

  Indie-folk. It's kind of like Ian William Craig doing midewest emo, if you can imagine that...

  [8.0/10]

## Abul Mogard - In a Few Places Along the River

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2635090814_16.jpg)

  One day I was chilling on the couch, and wanted to play his earlier stuff on YouTube and just stare at the sky turn from bright to navy blue. But then whenever a song ends the UberEat commercial always popped up, so it's not exactly the most satisfying experience...

  [8.6/10]
