### Various Artists - Somewhere Between: Mutant Pop, Electronic Minimalism & Shadow Sounds Of Japan 1980 - 1988

  ![]()

  Wife said she had a nightmare when I played this whiloe she was sleeping. Mystical left-field pop songs.

  [7.4/10]

### William Doyle - Great Spans Of Muddy Time

  ![]()

  While not as mesmerizing as his late 2019 album, this album is more droning and dissonant.

  [7.2/10]

  The only one who gets a pass for singing like they're breathing is named Kate Bush.

  [6.8/10]

### Curd Duca - Waves 1

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3962599587_16.jpg)

## 2018 Releases

## 2017 Releases

### Jazz Doummunisters - Cupid & Bataille, Dirty Microphone

  ![]()

  Weird spoken-word / jazz-hop by two Japanese middle aged men. One of them played in Cowboy Bebop's OST and Ground Zero, the other is a columnist and (I think) a visiting scholar in Keio university. Really weird stuff, but in the best way possible.

  [8.8/10]

## 2016 Releases

### Moe And Ghosts x 空間現代 - Rap Phenomenon

  ![]()

  Math rock-noise-rap? 感覺有點像玉手初美
