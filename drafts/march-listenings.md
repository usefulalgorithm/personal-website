## slowthai - UGLY

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1471897416_16.jpg)

  Abrasive post-punk + alternative rap. Wasn't much of a fan of his previous stuff but this I totally dig.

  [8.1/10]

## betcover!! - 時間

  Super psychedelic Japanese R&B. This one is really wild.

  [8.3/10]

## Ill Considered - Liminal State

  [7.6/10]

## Portico Quartet - Monument

  ![]()

## Kate NV - Wow

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3771144374_16.jpg)

  Left field synth pop. I like Nobukazu Takemura and Nyege Nyege Tapes so I like this.

  [8.3/10]

## King Tubby - The Best of Dub

  ![]()

  It is indeed the best of dub.

  [8.6/10]

## Ibrahim Alfa Jnr - Sirius A

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2820071275_16.jpg)

  Wonky techno. At first it sounded pretty fresh, but as I finish the album I feel that the tracks are just way too similar to each other both in terms of sonic texture and speed.

  [6.7/10]

## Enon - Grass Geysers... Carbon Clouds

  ![]()

  Noise pop / indie rock. Very radio friendly... not really my thing.

  [5.0/10]
