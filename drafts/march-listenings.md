## slowthai - UGLY

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1471897416_16.jpg)

  Abrasive post-punk + alternative rap. Wasn't much of a fan of his previous stuff but this I totally dig.

  [8.1/10]

## betcover!! - 時間

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0527064750_16.jpg)

  Super psychedelic Japanese R&B. This one is really wild.

  [8.3/10]

## Ill Considered - Liminal State

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3345063251_16.jpg)

  Modern spiritual jazz.

  [7.4/10]

## Kate NV - Wow

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3771144374_16.jpg)

  Left field synth pop. I like Nobukazu Takemura and Nyege Nyege Tapes so I like this.

  [8.3/10]

## King Tubby - The Best of Dub

  ![]()

  It is indeed the best of dub.

  [8.6/10]

## Ibrahim Alfa Jnr - Sirius A

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2820071275_16.jpg)

  Wonky techno. At first it sounded pretty fresh, but as I finish the album I feel that the tracks are just way too similar to each other both in terms of sonic texture and speed.

  [6.7/10]

## Enon - Grass Geysers... Carbon Clouds

  ![]()

  Noise pop / indie rock. Very radio friendly... not really my thing.

  [5.0/10]

## Material Girl - i85mixx21 22

  ![]()

  Experimental cloud hip-hop / drum & bass. This is so good.

  [8.4/10]

## Gorgonn - Six Paths

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2973359380_16.jpg)

  Claustrophobic, somewhat monotonic industrial noise-dub. Probably great as DJ material though.

  [6.6/10]
  
## Cecil Taylor Unit - Dark To Themselves

  ![](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273022566196f015bd5165e4cb1)

  Free jazz. Holy balls this is some intense music...

  [9.0/10]

## Fever Ray - Radical Romantics

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2669781793_16.jpg)

  Sounds like Bjork...

  [6.3/10]

## The Necks - Travel

  ![](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1007617714_16.jpg)

  Jazz-noir. Too minimalistic, sparse, and not in an interesting way.

  [6.8/10]

## Portico Quartet - Monument
